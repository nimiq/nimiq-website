Once the plastic has been classified, he heats up and compresses it into usable shapes. In his own words “These are not the prettiest of all items — we agree here — but they hold significant value. When you hold these pieces of craftsmanship you feel something different inside of you, that feeling is the power of change.” ",[],{"type":36,"text":9548,"spans":9549},"Back in 2018, Team Nimiq met Alejandro.

This has allowed L-ECO to grow beyond what he conceived. His workshop is hosted by Thomas Richie, one of the first foreigners that — enticed by its natural beauty — moved to Santa Teresa. Thomas became his sponsor, but more importantly, his good friend and ally in this endeavor. Through donations and support, you can help Alejandro and Thomas continue this valuable effort.

As you might know, Tendermint is a BFT protocol to get consensus. Previously the team started out by using pBFT but then decided to go for Tendermint since pBFT had certain limitations when used in a blockchain. Together with the switch to Tendermint, Handel had to be adapted as well. As Janosch explains in this video, Handel is a signature aggregation protocol that, as the name states, aggregates and broadcasts signatures. As Nimiq 2.0 will have 512 validators, having all of them communicating between each other is not efficient. The solution is to group validators so that messages are shared between groups, where each group already aggregates signatures of validators within that group before sharing it with other groups. This method reduces bandwidth usage and improves propagation speed. And on top of that, Handel is a generic protocol which will also help optimizing view changes in Nimiq 2.0. ",[12382],{"start":12383,"end":1219,"type":735,"data":12384},366,{"link_type":166,"url":12385,"target":169},"https://youtu.be/tfae8ld1ILc",{"type":1002,"text":12387,"spans":12388,"direction":697},"LibP2P",[],{"type":36,"text":12390,"spans":12391,"direction":697},"Sergio and Janosch have teamed up for this work.

The potential to save on fees is especially relevant when serving international clients. The cost to process an international bank transfer can be as high as $50. PayPal email invoicing costs 2.9% + a small additional flat fee for every transaction. As any freelancer or individual business owner will tell you, someone ultimately ends up paying these fees and ends up with less money in their pocket. Though crypto prices can fluctuate, this can be offset by the relatively low crypto transaction costs (below 40 cents and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can typically be converted to local currency at a cost of 1% or less). If the person receiving payment in crypto wants to minimise the short-term volatility risk, their option is to convert their crypto into local currency quickly after receiving it. ",[15686,15688,15691],{"start":1993,"end":10236,"type":735,"data":15687},{"link_type":166,"url":15632,"target":169},{"start":14136,"end":3161,"type":735,"data":15689},{"link_type":166,"url":15690,"target":169},"https://www.ofx.com/en-au/faqs/how-much-does-it-cost-to-send-money-internationally/",{"start":15692,"end":4112,"type":735,"data":15693},431,{"link_type":166,"url":15694,"target":169},"https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/email-invoice",{"type":2746,"url":15696,"alt":17,"copyright":17,"dimensions":15697,"id":15699,"edit":15700},"https://images.prismic.io/nimiq/478803d9-0531-4b1f-91c6-ca6c0fa9e3ee_blog_nimiq-launch-cryptopaymentlink_3.jpeg?auto=compress,format",{"width":5102,"height":15698},623,"YlUpfxIAACsAYfU6",{"x":93,"y":93,"zoom":179,"background":95},{"type":36,"text":15702,"spans":15703},"Many freelancers, individual business owners, and influencers already have a solid knowledge of the standard tools used to operate internationally.
