Users can buy NIM and BTC for up to $1'000 per month without having to rely on a custodial third-party intermediary holding the exchanged funds. The system has been thoroughly tested and in total ~85% of all Atomic Swaps were successful.

The system itself has also been further improved, for example the liquidity provider Fastspot now runs a so-called 'watchtower service' monitoring the blockchain and ensuring swaps succeed even if the user loses internet connectivity or closes the browser window. Overall, we're very excited that within this early time of releasing the beta, OASIS has already processed 1'650 successful swaps with overÂ $260'000Â in volume during Q1 2021 andÂ more than $375'000Â until today!",[59,63],{"start":60,"end":61,"type":62},486,494,"strong",{"start":64,"end":65,"type":62},524,542,{"type":47,"text":67,"spans":68},"What's to come?",[],{"type":25,"text":70,"spans":71},"Now that we have been able to gain further experience with OASIS over several weeks and have been able to make important improvements in almost all areas, it is time for OASIS to grow out of its earliest stage and finally lose its 'beta' label.",[],{"type":25,"text":73,"spans":74},"In the next step towards enabling the most decentralized and safest fiat on-ramp, we will launch the sell functionality of crypto against fiat and remove the initial $500 per-swap limit.

Our partner TEN31 Bank is already working on a KYC (Know Your Customer) solution that will enable higher swap limits in the future and Team Nimiq will support the bank in all aspects of this next step. As it is not yet determined when this KYC solution will go live, we have taken this as an opportunity to add a new milestone to our roadmap for 2021:Â Nimiq OASIS Pro, which will enable European users to perform non-custodial swaps between crypto and fiat with larger amounts after completing a KYC procedure with TEN31 Bank.",[78],{"start":64,"end":79,"type":62},539,{"type":47,"text":81,"spans":82},"OASIS 1% Fee: Details on the locking procedure",[],{"type":25,"text":84,"spans":85},"Since the launch of the Nimiq OASIS Public Beta on 18th February until Thursday 1st April, Nimiq OASIS has collected a total of US$ 2'690.00 (2.263,27 â‚¬) in fees from the swaps that have been performed during the first quarter. As previously announced, these collected fees will be used to buy NIM off the market for at least the first 24 months, which then are held by the Nimiq Foundation to increase scarcity and for the future benefit of the project. As a result of this plan, the first 225'242 NIM have been purchased on 1st April and are now stored on the preliminary holding addressÂ NQ23 6CYY 7AJG AM08 Y5G5 MHGX 6U4U 270A 7SH0Â that belongs to the Nimiq Foundation.
