However given these new engagements, the long-standing team has reached a quality and capacity such that no further hires are anticipated at this time. Marketing, Community, Content expenses were lower than the prior reporting period, which is mostly attributable to the holding pattern the project is in as it gets closer to releasing the Proof-of-Stake upgrade and a rerelease of OASIS with new payment service partners. With the increased support of open efforts such as the European “Kryptostadt” and Latin American “Criptociudad”, as well as creating awareness around Cryptopayment Link, all of which encourage the adoption of NIM, BTC and USDC in the payment acceptance and crypto holding process, we expect a reasonable increase in this expense category going forward.
