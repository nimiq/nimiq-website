It is the basis of decentralized exchanges: the Atomic Swap. Atomic Swaps allow direct exchange with crypto currencies across blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin for Ether without the risk that comes with organizations like centralized exchanges. Eliminating the need for these organizations reduces the risk of hacks and embezzlement. In an Atomic Swap, the buyer and the seller interact through a special kind of smart contracts. This type of smart contract locks the funds of the trading partners for the intended transaction. The transaction will only execute if certain conditions are met. This lock-up allows eliminating risk associated with third-party custodians, like an exchange or payment service provider.",[],{"type":25,"text":131,"spans":132},"Now, this swap mechanism works well between cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. But what if someone doesn’t want to convert between two cryptocurrencies but between a cryptocurrency and, let’s say, USD/EUR — like our online merchant? Up until now, this was impossible because conventional money can’t be locked on a blockchain.",[],{"type":25,"text":134,"spans":135},"Nimiq OASIS changes this by extending the concept of Atomic Swaps to conventional currencies!",[],{"type":25,"text":137,"spans":138},"This is possible by creating a smart contract that interacts with banking APIs. It creates a fiat counterpart to the crypto part of the Atomic Swap. With OASIS, online merchants can now accept crypto and receive national currency. This happens in a decentralized and safe way. It is possible to pair the sale of a cryptocurrency with the purchase of a conventional currency without the risks that come with a third party. It is like putting the Euro on the blockchain (but without a stable coin).",[],{"type":25,"text":140,"spans":141},"With “Nimiq Checkout”, the online merchants will be able to accept crypto payments and receive fiat payouts (EUR to begin) with little delay and at the lowest risk. At the same time, customers can pay with crypto (NIM, BTC & ETH to begin). Both parties benefit from zero risk exposure because the exchange process can not be manipulated by a third party.
