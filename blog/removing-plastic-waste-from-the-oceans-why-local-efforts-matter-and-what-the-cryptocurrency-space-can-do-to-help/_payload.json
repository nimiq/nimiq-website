It was during his daily commute that he started seeing plastic all over the place until one day he had an idea and decided to take action. ",[],{"type":25,"text":97,"spans":98},"With a piece of equipment that he built and attached to his bicycle, he collects plastics and microplastics, and ingeniously separates them from sand and other sediments through a manual filtering process. After gathering the plastic comes the task of classifying it. Not all plastics are the same and Alejandro is very mindful of this so that he does not create any additional pollution. Once the plastic has been classified, he heats up and compresses it into usable shapes. In his own words “These are not the prettiest of all items — we agree here — but they hold significant value. When you hold these pieces of craftsmanship you feel something different inside of you, that feeling is the power of change.” ",[],{"type":25,"text":100,"spans":101},"Back in 2018, Team Nimiq met Alejandro. After listening to him and his enthusiasm for conservation, a furnace was donated so that he could process the plastics he was picking up from Santa Teresa beach. We are very excited to announce that, years later, the same furnace is still up and running. Alejandro’s gentle heart has also captivated ex-pats from all over town. This has allowed L-ECO to grow beyond what he conceived. His workshop is hosted by Thomas Richie, one of the first foreigners that — enticed by its natural beauty — moved to Santa Teresa. Thomas became his sponsor, but more importantly, his good friend and ally in this endeavor. Through donations and support, you can help Alejandro and Thomas continue this valuable effort.
