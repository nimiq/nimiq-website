We are calling it the UTXOTree because it is a hybrid model between UTXO-based transactions and an Accounts Tree. In this novel data structure, the Accounts Tree provides easy access to all unspent transactions of an address thus giving all the benefits of an accounts-based model — e.g., provable account statements — while combining it with the power of UTXOs — e.g. having multiple in- and outputs per transaction. Additionally, the validity start height in transactions — required in Nimiq 1.0 — can be omitted, which simplifies the protocol and improves the network’s usability.",[147],{"start":148,"end":149,"type":150},559,580,"em",{"type":26,"text":152,"spans":153},"The UTXOTree is a rather technical upgrade to the Nimiq accounts data structure.

After discussions during the previous month, our Core Team has therefore decided to finish all the tasks related to the implementation of the Albatross consensus algorithm first.

A solution that takes advantage of Nimiq’s cryptography and also substitutes the infamous “Login with Google/Facebook” button sounds very sexy indeed, and that is why we are very excited about it. It is worth noting that such a solution would not use the Nimiq Blockchain, but use Nimiq’s public-key-cryptography and the Nimiq Hub to prove the users’ identity to web apps. Also important to consider is the fact that other crypto-based solutions like Digi-ID already exist. Such solutions seem to struggle in gaining momentum because one of the main reasons developers integrate “Login with Google/Facebook” is to take advantage of the existing information from the user that is stored by those social media platforms. Nimiq’s Front-end team is eager to work on NimiqID, but since Nimiq does not store any personal information, NimiqID is unlikely to be a game-changer at this time.
