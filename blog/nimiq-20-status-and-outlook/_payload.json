We built a simulator to test the feasibility of the approach and published a paper detailing the concept. To bring Albatross to the browser, we researched and developed zero knowledge proofs that will drive our nano nodes and make it possible to sync with the blockchain in seconds even on mobile devices. In mid 2019 the team started work on a Rust implementation of Nimiq 2.0, working on multiple aspects of the new blockchain in parallel. Since Nimiq 2.0 is a novel, cutting-edge technology, implementing it always involves research and continuously revising our approach: Throughout 2020 we implemented some parts of the blockchain, tested them in combination with other parts and discovered that some things don't perform to our expectations so we moved forward to look for superior solutions. For example, we replaced pBFT with Tendermint, our network stack with libp2p and had to rework and extend Handel multiple times. But with each iteration, Nimiq 2.0 got better.",[],{"type":45,"text":52,"spans":53},"The current state",[],{"type":26,"text":55,"spans":56},"The core team has now arrived at and is working on putting the key building blocks together. As of now we are testing and debugging the node implementation with all components necessary to run the Testnet. In a setup like this, issues often become apparent only after the previous issue has been solved, which unfortunately makes it hard to parallelize the coding work beyond a practical point. The issues in the code are oftentimes small, but difficult to reproduce and even more difficult to find. Other parts of the core team are currently improving various aspects of the blockchain: The Nano Sync is making good progress, staking-related transactions are being improved and work is being done on the network layer. At the same time our designers have been busy creating shiny new user interfaces for the staking feature of Nimiq 2.0. There will be further fine-tuning and iterations on the designs and they look very promising already.",[],{"type":58,"url":59,"alt":18,"copyright":18,"dimensions":60,"id":63,"edit":64},"image","https://images.prismic.io/nimiq/dfda0f80-f19d-4ef7-afca-ca12a6837b8e_blog_nimiq-20-status-and-outlook_2.png?auto=compress,format",{"width":61,"height":62},1600,800,"YlAcrxIAAC8AS4fc",{"x":40,"y":40,"zoom":65,"background":42},1,{"type":45,"text":67,"spans":68},"What's next?",[],{"type":26,"text":70,"spans":71},"Our current top priority in regards to Nimiq 2.0 is to get the public \"Aurora\" Testnet running. The Aurora Testnet is meant to let the broader community interact, test and push the network to its limits. However, at first it will require some technical knowledge to run it on your own machine. Bugs and changes are still to be expected in the early stages of the Aurora Testnet - after all, the Testnet exists to experiment and uncover issues!",[],{"type":26,"text":73,"spans":74},"The first version of the Aurora Testnet will include nodes that process the full chain (history nodes) but will not yet include light-weight nodes that can run in the browser (nano nodes).

Community developers can also start testing their apps and services based on the Testnet.",[],{"type":26,"text":79,"spans":80},"As soon as the blockchain code is reasonably stable and finished, it will receive extensive reviews by our security experts alongside a public bug-bounty program which will furthermore motivate external reviewers to harden the software and protocol of Nimiq 2.0.

We introduced the “lab” icons on the roadmap to reflect that time estimates for the release of Nimiq 2.0 are exactly that, estimates. We understand that those estimates still create expectations and are always encouraged by seeing our community so excited. While we have already come a long way and are continuously making good progress, we realize that we cannot keep the target of launching the Nimiq 2.0 Mainnet in Q1 2021 and have to update our guidance on that to the following quarters.
