Cryptocurrencies are all about decentralization and removing the middlemen — with the goal of being able to exchange value with a complete stranger without requiring up-front trust. Open blockchains do a great job on offering transactions between anyone without any trust required upfront. But what if you want to change coin A for coin B? Or even exchange coins for something else, like Euro? Usually nowadays, you will move your coins to an exchange and cash out to Euro. Or you send Euros via bank transfer or credit card and buy crypto. But when you do that, you depend on that service to deliver the counter value to you. If they change their mind, for example demand extra documents, or simply get hacked, then your funds are inaccessible or even gone.",[],{"type":25,"text":65,"spans":66},"That’s where atomic swaps shine!

The Keyguard just signed two transactions - one to fund a contract and one to redeem a contract — it also signed a third refund transaction, but let’s skip that for now. The wallet still knows what swap they are for and stores the transactions for now as they will only be sent in the next steps. The wallet then fetches the confirmed swap object from the Fastspot API to learn about which contracts are involved in the swap and to confirm that the swap is still happening.

For NIM this means waiting for the creation transaction to be mined into a block, for BTC it is enough when the transaction is in the mempool — with ‘replace-by-fee’ disabled — and for EUR this means OASIS reporting the contract to be cleared — FinTech-speak for ‘funded’.",[177],{"start":178,"end":179,"type":137},481,488,{"type":25,"text":181,"spans":182},"The wallet, via a swap-library — soon to be available for other projects as a package — monitors the respective blockchain or OASIS API for the criteria mentioned above, including validating that the amount, ownership, and expiry of the contract is correct.",[183],{"start":184,"end":185,"type":89},233,256,{"type":25,"text":187,"spans":188},"You as the user see this waiting period as the puzzle piece animating its labyrinth of lines and finally being filled with full color.",[],{"type":110,"url":190,"alt":38,"copyright":38,"dimensions":191,"id":194,"edit":195},"https://images.prismic.io/nimiq/40e9a531-d3c2-4235-ab64-af598f2bed62_blog_what-actually-happens-when-you-swap-in-the-nimiq-wallet_4.gif?auto=compress,format",{"width":192,"height":193},394,274,"YlAXQBIAACsAS2-C",{"x":42,"y":42,"zoom":117,"background":196},"#fff",{"type":78,"text":198,"spans":199},"Step 3: Fund the outgoing contract",[],{"type":25,"text":201,"spans":202},"Once the wallet is certain that Fastpot held up its part of the deal, the contract committing your side of the swap is created. This works the same way Fastspot did it: the wallet simply broadcasts your funding transaction, which you signed in the Keyguard earlier, to the respective blockchain. For EUR, it displays the payment details that you should use to send a SEPA Instant transaction to fund the OASIS contract. Again, we need to wait for the contract to be created irrevocably, meaning mined for Nimiq, in the mempool for Bitcoin, and status “cleared” in OASIS.

Remember how the wallet verified in step 1 that both contracts are secured by the same unlock-hash? It is now vital that they are indeed equal. First, Fastspot claims the contract that you created and transfers the funds out into its own wallet. To do that, Fastspot must include the swap secret — the key to unlock the contracts — into that claiming transaction! Put differently, it needs to present the key to be able to unlock the funds. Since the involved blockchains, as well as the OASIS API, are public, the wallet can obtain this secret from Fastspot’s transaction or from the OASIS contract.",[],{"type":25,"text":223,"spans":224},"Side-note for developers: Additionally to monitoring the respective blockchain or OASIS API on which the secret will be revealed, the wallet is also periodically checking the Fastspot API itself, where Fastspot reveals the secret once the contract is claimed on-chain, too.",[225],{"start":42,"end":226,"type":89},26,{"type":25,"text":228,"spans":229},"With the knowledge of the swap secret, the wallet can now claim your funds from the other contract.

The swap secret is not part of the transaction data that is signed, so adding the secret into the transaction is still possible and does not invalidate it.

This is a service that takes your pre-signed claiming transaction and monitors the swap progress. If it sees the secret, it will also broadcast your claiming transaction. This is a failover for when your wallet loses internet connection, your computer crashes, or you accidentally close the browser. However, it is important to remember that the watchtower is not a guarantee, but rather an additional safeguard to make sure that as many swaps as possible will be successful, which reduces the number of refunded swaps due to timeouts.",[244],{"start":42,"end":226,"type":89},{"type":78,"text":246,"spans":247},"Step 5b: Expired swaps and automatic refunds",[],{"type":25,"text":249,"spans":250},"But what happens when the secret never gets published? Then the timelock part of the Hashed Timelock Contract comes into play: after a predefined time, in our case 1.5 hours, the contracts expire, and the funds are automatically sent back to the original owners.
