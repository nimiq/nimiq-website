For example, if we are trying to prove the statement “I know a number y such that y2 – 4 = 0” then the circuit would be the function “y2 – 4 = 0” while the witness would be the number 2 because 22 – 4 = 0 is true.

The potential to save on fees is especially relevant when serving international clients. The cost to process an international bank transfer can be as high as $50. PayPal email invoicing costs 2.9% + a small additional flat fee for every transaction. As any freelancer or individual business owner will tell you, someone ultimately ends up paying these fees and ends up with less money in their pocket. Though crypto prices can fluctuate, this can be offset by the relatively low crypto transaction costs (below 40 cents and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can typically be converted to local currency at a cost of 1% or less). If the person receiving payment in crypto wants to minimise the short-term volatility risk, their option is to convert their crypto into local currency quickly after receiving it. ",[15617,15619,15622],{"start":1922,"end":10166,"type":663,"data":15618},{"link_type":167,"url":15563,"target":170},{"start":14067,"end":3090,"type":663,"data":15620},{"link_type":167,"url":15621,"target":170},"https://www.ofx.com/en-au/faqs/how-much-does-it-cost-to-send-money-internationally/",{"start":15623,"end":4042,"type":663,"data":15624},431,{"link_type":167,"url":15625,"target":170},"https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/email-invoice",{"type":2675,"url":15627,"alt":21,"copyright":21,"dimensions":15628,"id":15630,"edit":15631},"https://images.prismic.io/nimiq/478803d9-0531-4b1f-91c6-ca6c0fa9e3ee_blog_nimiq-launch-cryptopaymentlink_3.jpeg?auto=compress,format",{"width":5032,"height":15629},623,"YlUpfxIAACsAYfU6",{"x":94,"y":94,"zoom":180,"background":96},{"type":37,"text":15633,"spans":15634},"Many freelancers, individual business owners, and influencers already have a solid knowledge of the standard tools used to operate internationally.
