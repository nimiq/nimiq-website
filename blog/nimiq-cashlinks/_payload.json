It also requires some kind of software that the recipient would use to manage the newly received crypto assets, e.g. “some kind of wallet”.",[],{"type":25,"text":121,"spans":122},"The concept of Cashlinks has been part of the Nimiq Blockchain since the very beginning of the project, going back to the very first Betanet released in mid-2017, months before the Nimiq Mainnet. This feature comes naturally to Nimiq. The key here is that “kind of wallet”.

In other words, running your own Ethereum node is no piece of cake. But running a Nimiq Browser-Node IS a piece of cake. If you haven’t already, then try it out here!

That is why the real problem here is that if you send a private key to a new user then also you know that user’s private key, and you could therefore still control the funds. The solution is again Nimiq’s browser-first technology. By creating a go-between account that holds the Cashlink funds, you can send the private key of that temporary account to your friend with peace of mind.

The Nimiq Cashlink feature creates a temporary account to hold the NIM User A wants to send and creates a link from that. User A can now send the link to User B. Clicking this links opens Nimiq’s wallet app — directly in the browser, no software installation necessary.
