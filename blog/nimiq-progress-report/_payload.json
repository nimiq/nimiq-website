On top of that, the LibP2P implementation is built to also work in the browser’s network stack, thus a good step for Nimiq 2.0 to run in the browser while reusing the great work done by Protocol Labs already. Reusing this code has the big advantage of having an independent team working and improving the code instead of us recreating the code and maintaining it. In recent weeks, Nimiq Developers have been wrestling with some edge case bugs while integrating LibP2P into Nimiq 2.0, but it looks like we’re winning!",[57,64],{"start":39,"end":58,"type":59,"data":60},6,"hyperlink",{"link_type":61,"url":62,"target":63},"Web","https://libp2p.io/","_blank",{"start":65,"end":66,"type":59,"data":67},39,52,{"link_type":61,"url":68,"target":63},"https://protocol.ai/",{"type":51,"text":70,"spans":71},"Testnet",[],{"type":25,"text":73,"spans":74},"Intensive work is going towards setting up more and more complex test environments and running the Testnet implementation in it to do more and more thorough testing and debugging to get the Testnet ready for the public release.",[],{"type":25,"text":76,"spans":77},"As part of the process, a docker image has been created to set up a local Testnet on developers machines.

These topics are only on the drawing table at the moment, but we think they can be interesting for some community members. Nimiq 2.0 will need two transactions for unstaking, one to signal that you no longer want to stake and a second one to retrieve your funds once they are unstaked, which happens after the next macro block, maximum twelve hours later. Nimiq devs have been discussing how to keep the blockchain secure while ensuring a good user experience. The current solution we are working on is to sign both transactions at the same time and create some service that relays the second required transactions into the network after the next macro block — it’s an optional service that will make the system easier to use but does not compromise decentralization.",[],{"type":51,"text":96,"spans":97},"Validators",[],{"type":25,"text":99,"spans":100},"To improve the blockchain usability, Nimiq devs made it possible to switch validators instantly, with a single transaction.

While doing that, multi-coin support has been added, allowing the lib to support Bitcoin now. On top of that, Bluetooth support has been added as well, so that work can begin in the Wallet to support the new Ledger Nano X via Bluetooth. The lib has been reworked from scratch with a new architecture, opening it up for reuse by other developers that want to integrate Ledgers into their web apps.
