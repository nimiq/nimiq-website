For BTC it is necessary to get all unspent outputs across all used addresses and calculate the balance, whereas in Nimiq querying the balance is a single network request. The final implementation takes advantage of the Electrum network powering the Electrum wallet. The Front-end Team ended up reading source code of various libraries and reverse engineering APIs since documentation was limited and there is no Bitcoin dev center.

The new history tree is a tree structure which contains all the state changes that become part of the election block. A node then only needs an election block and the path in the tree to prove a transaction is part of it; so you only download chunks and a cryptographic proof. The history tree uses MMR (Merkle Mountain Ranges) and is an append only data-structure, but efficiently and fastly appended. Being cutting-edge technology, there was no library available to draw on.

Previously the team started out by using pBFT but then decided to go for Tendermint since pBFT had certain limitations when used in a blockchain. Together with the switch to Tendermint, Handel had to be adapted as well. As Janosch explains in this video, Handel is a signature aggregation protocol that, as the name states, aggregates and broadcasts signatures. As Nimiq 2.0 will have 512 validators, having all of them communicating between each other is not efficient. The solution is to group validators so that messages are shared between groups, where each group already aggregates signatures of validators within that group before sharing it with other groups.
