Nearly two years of legacy can’t and shouldn’t be neglected when embarking on a significant brand update.

We asked for input and got a lot of it — from rough directions to concrete and professional logo suggestions. Interestingly, in most of those suggestions, the hexagon played a central part. We, too, felt that the hexagon, standing on its stable side, was deeply connected with the Nimiq brand. Not only was it part of the logo, it was also used as a key visual for loaders, backgrounds or the world map in the miner, and even found its way into most community projects. We decided to keep it.",[],{"type":25,"text":72,"spans":73},"On the other hand, it was clear that we should get rid of the dollar sign — based on constant feedback from the community, and some very practical problems like the use as a currency symbol. The most obvious approach was to replace it with some form of an N, to build a stronger connection to the Nimiqwordmark and make it more recognizable.",[],{"type":75,"url":76,"alt":17,"copyright":17,"dimensions":77,"id":80,"edit":81},"image","https://images.prismic.io/nimiq/7b9c9a20-e7bc-4d32-9647-82df14bb8d7f_blog_a-new-visual-identity_5.jpeg?auto=compress,format",{"width":78,"height":79},3793,2965,"YlVN2BIAAC8AYp03",{"x":39,"y":39,"zoom":40,"background":41},{"type":25,"text":83,"spans":84},"Following those two prerequisites, and with our overall goal of simplicity in mind, we scribbled a lot and tried out a multitude of simple N-shaped logos, narrowed them down, decided on directions, iterated on them over and over again, until we ended up with a handful of logo options.
