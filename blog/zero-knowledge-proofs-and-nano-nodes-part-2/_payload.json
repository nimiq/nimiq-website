From a blockchain's perspective it‚Äôs very important that the proof is non-interactive because then it does not require the prover to be online and available for ‚Äúquestioning‚Äù at all times, instead, a static piece of data, the proof, is sufficient for one or many verifiers that can verify the proof independently.¬†",[],{"type":25,"text":127,"spans":128},"The first thing to know about Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (SNARKs) is that they have circuits and witnesses. By circuit we mean the program or function that is part of the statement that we are trying to prove. By witness we mean the specific values that make our statement true. For example, if we are trying to prove the statement ‚ÄúI know a number y such that y2¬†‚Äì 4 = 0‚Äù then the circuit would be the function ‚Äúy2¬†‚Äì 4 = 0‚Äù while the witness would be the number 2 because 22¬†‚Äì 4 = 0 is true. Thinking of the blockchain world, you can imagine the circuit to be a test whether the current blockchain is valid and the witness being the blocks in the chain. From a programmer's perspective, the circuit is the logic and the witnesses are the data.¬†",[],{"type":68,"text":130,"spans":131},"Private Witnesses",[],{"type":25,"text":133,"spans":134},"Another important detail is that witnesses can be public or private. Private witnesses are the ones that are known only to the prover, while public witnesses are the ones that are known to everyone, including the verifier. In the previous example the number y is a private witness. It is the prover that is saying that she knows that number, but she is not revealing it. This is a very important feature of zero knowledge proofs since it allows someone to prove something that they know without revealing what they know. A real world application of this property is that I can use a SNARK to prove that I know the secret key to a Nimiq wallet with 10 million NIMs in it, without actually revealing my secret key or even the address.",[],{"type":25,"text":136,"spans":137},"For the curious reader that checks all the footnotes: This example is actually pretty interesting and the concept used here is a big part of the circuit that Zcash uses.

Instead of having a circuit that verifies exactly N macro blocks, we can have a circuit that verifies up to N macro blocks.
