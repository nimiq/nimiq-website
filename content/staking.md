  items:
    - question: What is Staking?
      answer: Staking is the process of delegating tokens to a validator. The validator then uses these tokens to validate transactions and produce blocks on your behalf.
    - question: What is a validator?
      answer: A validator is the block producer of Proof-of-Stake blockchains, like a miner in Proof-of-Work blockchains. Validators produce blocks according to a consensus algorithm.
    - question: What is a staking pool?
      answer: While a validator is an individual entity, a staking pool combines the tokens of multiple participants into a single large entity, increasing their collective stake and chances of winning rewards.
    - question: How does staking help the Nimiq network?
      answer: Staking helps keep the Nimiq network secure and decentralized. The more NIM is staked and distributed evenly across validators, the stronger and healthier the network becomes, ensuring its reliability.
    - question: What happens if I don't stake?
      answer: You can choose not to stake and not earn any rewards. By not staking, you miss the opportunity to help maintain the network secure and decentralized.
    - question: How long does it take to have my funds available after I un-stake?
      answer: Once you un-stake your funds, it usually takes between 12 hours to 4 days for them to become available. The exact time frame depends on your validator's status. In rare cases, validators can be "jailed" for up to 4 days, which may delay access to your funds.
