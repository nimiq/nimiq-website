Nimiq Pay doesn't just aim to enable users to send and receive NIM; it lays the foundation for Nimiq to become the most widely accepted crypto payment ecosystem by integrating methods and ideas from conventional payment apps and bringing them to the crypto world; Nimiq Pay is an app designed from the ground up with mass adoption and convenience in mind. It helps to realise Satoshi's vision of self-custodial, peer-to-peer cash without intermediaries.

### Empowering Users with Cryptocity Points

At the heart of our launch is the innovative Cryptocity Points system, a feature designed to reward users for adopting crypto while educating them about the cryptocurrency landscape. This initiative is more than just a reward system; it's an educational journey that guides new users through the ins and outs of digital currency, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the technology that powers Nimiq. Nimiq Pay is also a tool to facilitate adoption and marketing campaigns.

A key next step in our journey is to engage with brands, agencies and external parties interested in using the Nimiq Pay & Cryptocity infrastructure to run marketing campaigns. This collaboration aims to further expand our ecosystem and bring more value to users and partners alike.

### Integrations with Third-Party Payment Providers

Looking ahead, we're pleased to announce that Nimiq Pay will soon offer integrations with third-party payment providers. This is a key development in our quest to ensure that users of the Nimiq Pay app can make payments in as many places as possible. By combining multiple payment networks under the single Nimiq umbrella, we're simplifying the payment process, making it easier, faster and more seamless for everyone involved. Stay tuned for more updates on this front as we're eager to share the fruits of our labour with you.

### A Nod to Our Community: The Pillars of Testing
