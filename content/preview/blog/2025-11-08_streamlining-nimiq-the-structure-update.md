In our last update, we shared that we were taking time to rethink our strategy and restructure our work processes. Over those same months, many of you have been asking questions in our community channels, about everything from marketing plans and development priorities to partnerships, product features, and how we're organized. To properly answer many of these questions, we first needed to complete this restructuring, to get everyone on the same page and establish a clear direction we can stand behind.

That's why we're doing two things today. First, we're sharing the new organizational structure as a result of this work. Second, we're answering the questions we've collected in the last three months from you across our community channels like Telegram, Discord, and the Forum. You'll find these questions and answers posted in the Nimiq Forum. With this new structure, the right teams/bodies can now give you clear, accountable answers on the topics they own.

## The New Structure:  How We're Organized

Our new structure is built around a few main bodies and teams:

![](/assets/images/prismic/aQ6f47pReVYa4Qng_NimiqOrganizationOverviewimagev1.2-1-.png)

### Foundation Board

The Nimiq Foundation Board, consisting of Mauricio, Elion, Marvin, Max, Pascal, Philipp, and Richy, makes sure we follow our mission while meeting our legal and financial supervisory responsibilities. It has the final vote on major decisions.

### Strategy Committee

Led by Max, Philipp, and Richy, this committee sets our long-term strategy. They decide which products and initiatives to prioritize, and where Nimiq should position itself in the market. They collaborate with all execution teams to put the strategy into action.

### Cross-Organizational Functions

Three roles work across the entire organization to keep things running smoothly:

**Organizational Development:** Inês C. helps improve our structure by gathering feedback, providing coaching, helping define roles, and mediating conflicts, all to maintain a transparent and cooperative space.

**Accounting:** Allan makes sure our financial processes are accurate and consistent, from managing payments and processing compensations to preparing budgets, financial reports, and handling tax filings.

**Operations**: Elion manages the majority of our financial and administrative operations and serves as eye on compliance and liaison to our legal representation. His role also includes strategic and business development advisory and support.

**Legal**: Mauricio leads our legal representation and counsel. He advises the project on all significant regulatory and legal matters, both locally and internationally.

### Engineering Teams

Our engineering efforts are split into three teams. **Team 1**, led by Claudio and including JD, Maxi, and Philipp, is focused on ecosystem tools like the Nimiq Map and our upcoming new products, **Team 2**, led by Basti and composed of Inês C., Pascal, Matheo, and Daniel, is dedicated to the core blockchain protocol, interoperability, and the Nimiq Wallet. **Team 3**, led by Stefan and including Sören, Alberto, Marvin, and [hrxi](https://github.com/hrxi), is building and maintaining our payment applications, including the Nimiq Pay App and integrations like Fastspot.

### Central Teams

These teams support the entire organization with shared services.

The **UX/UI Design team** is led by Julian (Overnice) with Fons.

The **Communication & Marketing team** is led by Richy with Micha, Martin, Tammo, and Inês M. They handle the website, marketing campaigns, and community engagement.

The **Commercial team** is led by Max and Roberto. They focus on partnership relations, sales, and the Cryptocity project.

The **IT team** is led by Jeff with Curd and Francisco. They manage our internal infrastructure.

### How We Work Together

This structure creates both clear reporting lines and cross-functional collaboration.

**Reporting Structure:**

- **Team Leads** (Engineering and Central Teams) report to the **Strategy Committee**, keeping their work connected to our strategic priorities.
- The **Strategy Committee** reports to the **Board**, submitting strategic direction, budget proposals, and escalating major decisions outside of its domain and authority.

**Cross-Functional Collaboration:**

- **Engineering and Central Teams** work in close partnership on product features and new projects. For example, our Commercial team works directly with the engineering teams to deliver new products, while the Design and Marketing teams coordinate with them to build and launch new features.
- **Organizational Development, HR Management, Operations and Legal** support all teams, providing essential services and process facilitation. They connect with both the Strategy Committee for planning and individual teams for day-to-day operations.

This setup gives teams the freedom to work independently while staying connected to strategy, operations, and support when they need it.

## Any Questions?

This structure is effective immediately, but we'll continue to adjust it as we go. We expect a transition period as teams adapt to their new responsibilities.

We're committed to being transparent. We hope this gives you a better sense of how Nimiq operates.

You'll see this new structure in action right away. Head over to the Nimiq Forum, where we've posted your questions in the “Questions” section along with answers from our teams. Keep asking questions as they come up. The appropriate teams will respond within two weeks, making sure you get answers from team members in charge.

Pura Vida,

Team Nimiq
