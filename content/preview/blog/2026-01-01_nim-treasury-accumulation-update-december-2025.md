## Overview

In line with our ongoing [NIM Treasury Accumulation Plan](https://www.nimiq.com/blog/announcing-the-nim-treasury-accumulation-plan) announced on August 28, 2025, this brief disclosure summarizes NIM accumulation activity, key statistics, and transparency commitments, including cumulative totals and the average purchase price range for the period of December 2025.

## Program Recap

The NIM Treasury Accumulation Plan authorizes purchasing up to 5% of the circulating NIM supply over a six-month period with a budget capped at $1 million USD. Purchases are deliberately paced over time to avoid predictability, with no public price ceiling, but internal guardrails ensure disciplined execution. Funds originate from existing treasury reserves. All acquired NIM is held in publicly verifiable addresses. Future reports will continue to provide regular updates on the progress of this plan. It is important to emphasize that the accumulation plan does not constitute investment advice or a forecast regarding the future price of NIM.

## Transparency & Custody

We plan on issuing a report like this monthly until the end of the accumulation period, providing regular, transparent updates on the progress of the [NIM Treasury Accumulation Plan](https://www.nimiq.com/blog/announcing-the-nim-treasury-accumulation-plan). This announcement describes a treasury allocation policy and is not investment advice, a prediction of future performance, or an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any asset. The authorization is capped and discretionary. Timing, size, venues, and execution methods may vary based on market conditions and internal risk controls. We make no commitments regarding price, returns, or market impact. All purchases will be conducted in accordance with applicable requirements and good faith market practices. Beyond accumulation activities, we remain focused on building and ensuring our treasury keeps pace with the project’s long-term vision.
