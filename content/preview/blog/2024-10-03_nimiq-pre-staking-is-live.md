We're excited to announce that the Nimiq Pre-staking Rewards and Giveaway Campaign is live and will run from **Monday October 7 to Sunday November 10! **The campaign is aimed at supporting a smooth migration to Nimiq's new Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which is planned to begin November 19 ([learn more about the migration process](https://www.nimiq.com/blog/nimiq-pos-migration-process-starts/)). This campaign rewards everyone that supports the migration by pre-staking their NIM ([rules apply](https://prestaking.nimiq.network/Nimiq_Pre-staking_Campaign_ToS.pdf)). There are 200 million NIM in rewards up for grabs!

### Why Participate in Pre-Staking?

Pre-staking is an essential step for the successful transition to Nimiq PoS. A secure migration depends on maximizing the total amount of NIM pre-staked and distributing it across as many validators as possible. This campaign is designed to incentivize all Nimiq Holders to pre-stake and contribute to a more decentralized Nimiq network.

**IMPORTANT: All pre-staked NIM will be locked until the migration is complete.**

The Nimiq core team has worked diligently to harden and improve the security and performance of the Nimiq PoS codebase. This new implementation has also been peer-reviewed by Nimiq community developers. Earlier this year, Nimiq organized code audits and a public bug bounty program in collaboration with the renowned security audit company HackerOne ([listen to the Twitter Space here](https://x.com/nimiq/status/1793642221704724940)).

The migration process itself has undergone multiple rounds of testing [together with community developers](https://x.com/nimiq/status/1783338363660951860).

Team Nimiq has done everything possible to ensure the success of the migration, transitioning from PoW to PoS is an inherently complex process. This campaign is a token of appreciation to all Nimiq community members who support the pre-staking process, trusting in the careful preparation carried out by both the Nimiq developers and the community.

### Who Can Participate?

Anyone holding or acquiring NIM can join in on the campaign—except for residents from countries on the [OFAC sanctions](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) list and the USA.

### Campaign Duration

- **Start:** Monday October 7, 2024 (~00:01 UTC)

### What’s Up for Grabs? 200 Million NIM!

The earlier you participate, the more rewards you can potentially get. Plus, it's a key way to help secure the network.

Pre-staking isn’t just for hardcore users—it’s an easy and rewarding way for every NIM holder to get involved without a long-term commitment.

A total of 200 million NIM (!) are allocated in the Pre-staking Campaign:

1. 100 million NIM as Pre-staking Rewards: based on your stake in proportion to the total amount of NIM pre-staked.
1. 100 million NIM in additional Bonus Giveaways: your chances increase as you accumulate points for staking a certain way (timing, choice of pool, etc):

- 10 giveaways of 3 million NIM
- 25 giveaways of 1 million NIM
- 65 giveaways of 500’000 NIM

### Get Multipliers for Higher Chances to get a Bonus:

Boost your chances of receiving bonus giveaways by earning multipliers:

- **Pre-stake early**: The earlier you pre-stake, the higher your time-based multiplier.
- **Choose an underdog validator**: Select a validator with less than 10% of the total pre-stake for an additional multiplier.
- **Join the Nimiq Galxe quests**: Earn more multipliers based on your ranking in [Nimiq's Galxe Space.](https://galxe.com/nimiq)

The more you optimize your pre-staking strategy, the better your chances!

Choose a validator from the list. Picking a validator with a lower amount of staked funds helps decentralize the network and grants you a bonus multiplier in the Pre-staking Giveaway.

**4. Enter Your Amount**
