    Data Protection

    Data protection is of a particularly high priority for us. This page is used to inform website visitors regarding our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when they use the Nimiq Website and Web Apps (“Service”). As a matter of course, we comply with the EU's [General Data Protection Regulation](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-5419-2016-INIT/en/pdf)("GDPR").

    We generally don’t store your data. We routinely delete our server logs every 30 days. If you are a holder of NET and go through the NIM Activation procedure, a [supplemental policy](/activation/privacy) applies, and additional personal information is gathered.

    Log Data

    We want to inform you that whenever you visit our Service, we collect information that your browser sends to us which is called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser version, operating system, the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), the sub-websites, the date and time of access to the Internet site, pages and time spent thereon, the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology and other statistics. This information is deleted after 30 days unless there is a legal or other reason to store it longer or to otherwise comply with the law or law enforcement authorities.

    Nimiq does not draw any conclusions about you. Rather, the Log Data is needed to provide our services, including our Apps and this Site, and improve them over time, deliver the content of our website correctly, optimize the content of our website, and ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology.

    Service Providers

    We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service; provide the Service on our behalf; perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. We want to inform you that these third parties have access to your personal information. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

    Newsletter

    If you sign up for our newsletter, which is administered through Mailchimp, Mailchimp will store some of the data subject’s information, including email address, on a Mailchimp server. The data will only be used to send our newsletter. Neither we nor Mailchimp will ever sell the email address of the data subject or share it with any other party unless we are legally compelled to do so. Only authorized Mailchimp employees and Nimiq administrators have access to our subscriber list. For more information, read the Privacy Policy of Mailchimp. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated at any time and the consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time.

    Links to Other Sites

    Our Service contains links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

    You have the Right of Confirmation, Right of Access, Right to Rectification, Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten), Right of Restriction of Processing, Right to Data Portability, Right to Object, Right to Withdraw Data Protection Consent and other rights under the GDPR.

    Profiling

    We do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.

    Changes to This Privacy Policy

    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
