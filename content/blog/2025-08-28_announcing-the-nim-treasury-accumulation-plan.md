In our last community update we spoke about the transformation underway at Nimiq and we reaffirmed our commitment to NIM. Today we are following through in a simple and deliberate way. We are launching the **NIM Treasury Accumulation Plan**, an ongoing program to accumulate NIM from the open market into treasury reserves. This is not a grand reveal. It is a practical step that aligns our balance sheet with where the project is heading.

## Why we are doing this

NIM sits at the center of what we are building, so our treasury should reflect that center of gravity. Accumulating NIM in the reserve is a straightforward way to align our balance sheet with our direction and to be prepared for the next phase of the project. It sets us up to design token mechanics from a position that matches our focus, and it expresses long‑term alignment without any need for big statements.

We also want to be clear about context. Broader market sentiment has been healthy while sentiment around NIM has lagged. The thoughtful response is not spectacle but consistency. A disciplined accumulation plan signals where we stand, supports better economic design over time, and allows us to keep building while the treasury quietly moves into a posture that fits our ambitions.

## How the plan works

The guidance is clear: permission and intention to purchase up to **5% of circulating NIM** with a **budget of $1MM USD** over an initial **six month** window. The plan takes effect as of the publication of this post. Pacing will remain disciplined and may adapt to conditions.

Purchases will follow a steady cadence that avoids predictability. Most of the time we will accumulate in smaller clips spread out over time. We will not publish a price ceiling. Public ceilings invite gaming and they tend to distort books around a single level. We do maintain internal guardrails and we will continue to review them as the market evolves.

Funds will be converted from our existing treasury, which already includes a mix of crypto assets and stable assets. Acquired NIM will be held as a long term treasury reserve in visible addresses.

## Transparency and custody

Transparency matters and execution quality matters as well. To balance the two, we will report after the fact. As applicable, we will publish a short disclosure that includes cumulative totals and an average purchase price range. We will maintain a reference list of the treasury addresses that hold the accumulated NIM. Many treasury addresses are already public, and we will add the new reserve addresses to that list so anyone can verify balances.

We are intentionally avoiding real time disclosure. Real time signals can be used to front run or lean against the program, and they are not required to achieve the transparency the community rightly expects. You will still have a clear picture of what was accumulated and where it sits.

## What this is, and what it is not

This is straightforward treasury management that aligns reserves with strategy. It is not a mechanism to engineer market outcomes, and it is not a promise about future price or returns. Markets move for many reasons and our job is to build valuable things while stewarding the treasury responsibly.

We also want to clarify language. It is common to call any program like this a buyback. In traditional finance that word is often tied to the retirement of shares. In crypto it is sometimes used for burns. That is not what we are doing. We are increasing the NIM allocation in the treasury, holding it in reserve, and disclosing our approach. The label is less important than the policy, and the policy is designed to be measured, auditable, and aligned with the road ahead.

## What to expect next

The plan is live as of today. You will see the first disclosure soon, which will include totals to date and the addresses holding the purchased NIM. Beyond that, we remain focused on building, and this plan ensures that our treasury keeps pace with that focus.

**Important notice**

This announcement describes a treasury allocation policy. It is not investment advice, a prediction of future performance, or an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any asset. The authorization is capped and discretionary. Timing, size, venues, and execution methods may vary based on market conditions and internal risk controls. We make no commitments regarding price, returns, or market impact. Purchases will be conducted in accordance with applicable requirements and good faith market practices.
