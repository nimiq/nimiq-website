Nimiq’s Community Funding initiative was created to provide support, mentorship and necessary seed funding to community developers who want to create NIM-based projects and add to Nimiq’s growing ecosystem.

However, Nimiq like every other crypto project has finite resources and this means that only the very best ideas and concepts can be backed. So, who decides which community projects will be backed? The Community Funding Board does.

## What is the community funding board?

Nimiq’s vision is to grow this initiative with an ethos of ‘by the community, for the community’. That’s why the Community Funding Board is made up of three community representatives who, together with three members from the team, analyze and make judgments on which community proposals are to be supported.

The Community Funding Board is set to play an important role in the future growth of the Nimiq ecosystem and that is why it’s important for all Nimiq community members to vote for Board candidates who share their vision for Nimiq.
