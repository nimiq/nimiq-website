We are happy to announce that [Nimiq](https://www.nimiq.com/) has been accepted as a member of the Brussels-based [Blockchain for Europe](https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/) association. Blockchain for Europe represents international blockchain industry players at the EU-level and contributes to the regulatory debate by supporting European decision-makers in their goal to make blockchain technology a success. The association closely collaborates with national and global players – both at legislative as well as industry level – to support the promotion of and education about blockchain technology.

Blockchain for Europe’s main objective is to drive integrity, innovation and empowerment through blockchain, mainly within a European context, but also as a thought leader for other countries and jurisdictions around the world. Being based among the most important institutions of the European Union in Brussels, the association is working with the European Commission, Members of the European Parliament and other political stakeholders across the member states to support them with insights and consulting when it comes to blockchain and distributed ledger technology as well as digital assets based on those technologies.

The association closely monitors all relevant regulatory developments in the blockchain sector and upcoming EU regulations dealing with applications of blockchain technology, such as the [Markets in Crypto Assets (*MiCA*)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593), the [DLT Pilot Regime](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/200924-presentation-proposal-market-infrastructures-pilot-regime_en.pdf) and the [upcoming Data Act](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digital-services-act-package), a set of new rules for a safer and more open digital space across the whole EU. With a strong focus on education and outreach, Blockchain for Europe strives to foster the development of the new digital economy and helps to shape regulatory foundations for a future of Blockchain-based application, such as cross-border payments.

With joining the association, Nimiq aims to underpin the project's effort to become a notable and respected supporter of beneficial European crypto regulations and the blockchain space in general, especially when it comes to cross-border online payments. Besides joining forces for educational and outreach efforts, we are also pleased to join the ranks of a worldwide network of experts, industry influencers and academic partners, represented not only by a [strong board and advisory council](https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/about/) but — of course — also by the association's fellow members.
