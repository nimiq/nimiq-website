Team Nimiq will have a prominent appearance in the 1st International Summer School on Security & Privacy for Blockchains and Distributed Ledger Technologies. This will be jointly organized by members of the Technical University of Vienna ([TU Wien](https://tuwien.ac.at/)), [Princeton University](https://princeton.edu/) and [SBA Research Center for Information Security](https://www.sba-research.org/).

The event came to our attention thanks to some friends who are organizers from TU Vienna. Given the technical focus of the event and the contributive spirit of Nimiq, we decided to support the project as a Platinum Sponsor.

## Nimiq at the event

As a sponsor, we get the special opportunity of presenting Nimiq at the conference. The summer school, code name #BDLT19, is one of the most interesting conferences of the year for Nimiq to give an in-depth explanation of [Albatross](https://medium.com/nimiq-network/research-collaboration-albatross-63599386a7c9) to an experienced audience of engineers and researchers. Not only is Pascal, Blockchain Developer of Nimiq, giving a talk about Albatross, but Nimiq will also have a workshop for attendees to get their hands on Nimiq. In the workshop, we will teach attendees to interact with the blockchain directly using JavaScript.

Schedule of the event. Nimiq’s presentation will take place Wednesday 4

As part of this unique occasion, Nimiq is giving away two event access tickets to our loyal Community (EUR 1300 value each!). The conference will take place in Vienna, coming September 2–5, 2019. If you are a Nimiq supporter near the area, you can participate to win a ticket for the conference by sending a message with your full name to [community@nimiq.com](mailto:community@nimiq.com). Team Nimiq is in the process of building something amazing with Nimiq 2.0 and we would love to share it with a couple of Nimiq die-hard fans and #BDLT19 school seems to be the perfect setting.

## Rules of the contest

- Send an e-mail with your full name to [community@nimiq.com](mailto:community@nimiq.com)
- You have time to participate until Friday, August 16 2019
- The winners will be chosen randomly by Team Nimiq and announced the same day
- Winners will each receive one event access ticket
- (ticket not refundable for cash value, regular registration and accommodation info: [https://bdlt.school/registration/](https://bdlt.school/registration/))

Discussions in the #BDLT19 school will revolve around novel attacks on distributed systems, consensus protocols and fault tolerance, incentive structures such as Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, blockchain scalability, payment channels, and state channels. These topics match exactly the current points of interest of the Nimiq Blockchain Team, so we expect to also learn a lot from other high-impact research projects. See you there!
