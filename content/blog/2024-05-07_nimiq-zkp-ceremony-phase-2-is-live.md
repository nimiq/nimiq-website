Following the successful completion of Phase 1 of the Zero-Knowledge Proof Setup Ceremony, we are excited to progress to the **next and last phase**.

This phase in particular is crucial for the upcoming migration to Nimiq Proof-of-Stake. You can still contribute, even if you didn't join Phase 1. To participate read this blog post and fill out the form at the bottom**.**

For those new to the ZKP Ceremony, we encourage you to visit [**the introductory blog post**](https://www.nimiq.com/blog/nimiqs-zero-knowledge-proof-setup-ceremony-join-and/) to get up to speed on the process and its relevance to blockchain technology.

## Phase 1 Termination and Results

We are pleased to announce the conclusion of Phase 1 of the Nimiq ZKP Ceremony, in which there was strong participation from 92 contributors over the course of 9 rounds.

The beacon's hash was selected from the Bitcoin blockchain (**Block #840514**), which has the hash ‘000000000000000000023d754340f19f2de938d5343408cacce3a95c362e4d58’. For developers and open-source enthusiasts, [**the attestation repository is accessible here**](https://github.com/nimiq/ceremony-attestations), providing all necessary files to utilize Phase 1 outputs.

In a commitment to transparency and security, the beacon hash for this phase was set using the GitHub repository of the attestations at [**this commit**](https://github.com/nimiq/ceremony-attestations/commit/b03357ac78cc6fa9db9bcd9be99798c2da0f786a).

## Phase 2 Begins

The next step in enhancing the Nimiq blockchain's security has arrived with the launch of Phase 2. Enrollment is now officially open!

The previous phase benefited the entire cryptocurrency space, but this next and final phase is specifically used for Nimiq Proof-of-Stake. It is vital to spread the word and encourage involvement to ensure its success.

To participate please fill out [**the enrollment form** ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRuko1lfjMNYueI7J1YF4G0Wwyp3EuJggeEjEKqHEzGbRG0w/viewform?usp=sf_link)and join us in shaping the future of blockchain technology.

## Frequently Asked Questions

As we transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 of the Nimiq ZKP Ceremony, we have compiled a list of frequently asked questions based on the inquiries and feedback from the first phase. We hope this compilation will clarify any doubts and assist participants as we continue with this critical process.

### 1.1- I have enrolled for phase 1, do I have to enroll again for phase 2?

Yes! Each round has a new pair of keys. The keys from phase 1 should not be reused, they should be destroyed after publishing the attestation file as instructed on the round termination post/email. To enroll in phase 2 follow the link in 1.2.

### 1.2- Can I still enroll in the ZKP Ceremony despite it having started already?

Yes, you can! [**Fill out this form to enroll**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRuko1lfjMNYueI7J1YF4G0Wwyp3EuJggeEjEKqHEzGbRG0w/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### 1.3- For how long will the ceremony last? And each phase and round?

So far, Team Nimiq expects the full ceremony (phases 1 and 2) to take several months. Each phase is divided into several rounds until all participants have contributed. We aim to have each round lasting for a week.

### 1.4- How many rounds, participants/round, and how long does a round take for phases 1 and 2?

Phase 1 had 9 rounds, each lasting a full week, with 20 participants enrolled. Phase 2 will work similarly. However, it is subject to change and we cannot foresee how many rounds it will have, since people are still allowed to enroll.

### 1.5- What are the selection criteria for the rounds?

We prioritize the following:

- having already contributed to Phase 1
- enrolling with a Discord user that is on the server
- knowledge level
- submission order

### 1.6- How do I know when I am scheduled to contribute?

A few days to a week before the round starts, you will receive an email with the information you need to contribute to the round. This email will have all the needed information as well as a Discord channel link. We recommend you join it for faster message exchanges between you and Team Nimiq in case assistance is needed.

### 1.7- Will everyone enrolled in the ceremony be assigned to a round and able to contribute?

Nimiq will try to provide everyone who enrolled with the opportunity to participate in one round. This is not guaranteed because the ceremony could end up lasting up to a year. Also, it is not guaranteed that everyone will successfully contribute, since many factors can prevent a successful contribution, such as a machine and/or internet connection being too slow.

With the transition to Proof-of-Stake around the corner, entering Phase 2 of the ZKP ceremony becomes the next vital step for our community to contribute to Nimiq's security. A big thank you to everyone who participated in Phase 1—your involvement has been crucial. We encourage you to continue with us into Phase 2.

[**Join Phase 2 if you haven’t already**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRuko1lfjMNYueI7J1YF4G0Wwyp3EuJggeEjEKqHEzGbRG0w/viewform?usp=sf_link), and help spread the word to bring in as many participants as possible. Together, we can ensure this next chapter succeeds and further strengthens the Nimiq community.

Pura Vida,

Team Nimiq
