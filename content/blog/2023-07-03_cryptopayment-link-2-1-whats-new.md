We are thrilled to announce that the latest version of CryptoPayment Link is now live!

All the changes and new features detailed below have been implemented.

## New Cryptocurrency Support: Goodbye Ethereum, Hello USD Coin

As part of our continuous efforts to harmonize our product offerings, we've said goodbye to Ethereum (ETH) and welcomed USD Coin (USDC) on the Polygon network. USDC has fully taken the place of ETH in the app.

## Speak Your Language with CryptoPayment Link

To cater to our growing user base from non-English speaking countries, we've added multi-language support to CryptoPayment Link. This feature ensures our users feel more comfortable navigating the platform, particularly during promotional campaigns in these regions. The first languages we support are Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese. However, we encourage you to contact us through [our community channels](https://www.nimiq.com/community/) if there are any other languages we should prioritize.

## A More Familiar Login Process

Understanding that the simplicity and familiarity of processes contribute greatly to a positive user experience, we've switched the login from email-only to an email/password combination. Logging into CryptoPayment Link now feels just like any other familiar platform you use, and you are not limited by the device on which you open your email.

## Seamless Integration with the Nimiq Wallet

Always looking for ways to make our services more user-friendly, especially for those new to the crypto world, we've introduced an entry point to the Nimiq Wallet for new users, providing seamless integration between the two platforms.

## Clear Distinction Between Employee and Guest Views

To enhance the day-to-day user experience, we've updated the interface to clearly distinguish between the Employee View and Guest Account. Users now find it easier to identify their account status, simplifying operations and workflow.
