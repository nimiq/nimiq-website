In line with the [last report](https://medium.com/nimiq-network/transparency-report-74d4d89933fe), we would like to present an updated overview of the assets and use of funds for the Nimiq project, as well as updated details of the distribution of NIM tokens with circulating and total supply. The period covered since the last report is August 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019. The report indicates a significant reduction in expenses and burn-rate due to reduced operational overhead (not a reduction in team size).

## Assets and use of funds

### Assets

The Nimiq Project continues to hold a variety of liquid and non-liquid assets. The 9.9% stake in German WEG Bank AG is a [new acquisition](https://www.nimiq.com/blog/nimiq-acquires-stake-in-weg-bank-ag/). Note that the crypto assets are considered not liquid.

## NIM supply and distribution

In this second part, we would like to describe the distribution of NIM tokens, showing details of accounts and vesting contracts as well as the circulating and total supply as of the end of July.

### Quick view

Just the current circulating NIM supply: [http://nim.sh/stats/supply/circulating/nim.txt](http://nim.sh/stats/supply/circulating/nim.txt)

The total final NIM supply in ~100 years by design of the Nimiq Blockchain protocol: **21'000'000'000 NIM**

### Details

**NIM activated from Token Sale NET** (5% of final total): As of June 30 2019, 845’097’617 NIM have been activated from NET and are part of the circulating supply. The remaining difference (~204'902'383 NIM) that has not been activated from NET is visible at account addresses [NQ69 9A4A MB83 HXDQ 4J46 BH5R 4JFF QMA9 C3GN](https://nimiq.watch/#NQ69+9A4A+MB83+HXDQ+4J46+BH5R+4JFF+QMA9+C3GN) and [NQ15 MLJN 23YB 8FBM 61TN 7LYG 2212 LVBG 4V19](https://nimiq.watch/#NQ15+MLJN+23YB+8FBM+61TN+7LYG+2212+LVBG+4V19). Though the deadline for activating NIM has long passed, Nimiq is processing requests on a case by case, manual basis (applying the same conditions of KYC/AML). Being conservative, Nimiq considers them part of the circulating supply.

All other NIM are either acquired through mining or released through a vesting contract (all vesting durations are measured from April 14 2018).

**NIM minable** (88% of final total): 18'480'000'000 NIM over ~100 years. As of the end of June (~12.3% of final total): 2’593’189’595 NIM, part of circulating supply. The live amount is available here: [http://nim.sh/stats/supply/mined/nim.txt](http://nim.sh/stats/supply/mined/nim.txt)

Vesting is 26'250'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of June, 52’500’000 NIM are part of the circulating supply.

Vesting is 21'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of June, 42’000’000 NIM are part of the circulating supply.
