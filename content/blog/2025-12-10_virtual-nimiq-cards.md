## Nimiq Virtual Cards are here!

Imagine you could spend your crypto via self-custodial crypto payments at normal stores with a normal tap because it plugs directly into the systems merchants already use. No need for the merchant to be crypto-educated, no additional hardware, no questions, no friction!

The Nimiq team is pleased to announce the completion of the next milestone for self-custodial NIM payments: the launch of the **Nimiq’s virtual NAKA Card**.

Starting today, Android users from, and within, the countries surrounding the current NAKA hotspots* can activate a self-custodial Nimiq Card directly in the app after a short verification process. For now, the virtual card is primarily useful for users living in or frequently traveling to Switzerland and El Salvador, where the NAKA Payment Network is already active at select merchant locations.

## A New Milestone for Self-Custodial NIM Payments

The launch of the virtual Nimiq Card in Nimiq Pay marks another important leap toward achieving global **self-custodial payment coverage for the NIM coin**. With this step, Nimiq positions itself as a leader in bringing decentralized card payments into a familiar, mainstream user experience. The collaboration with NAKA reflects Nimiq's commitment to early-tech adoption in self-custodial payments and aligns with the high technological standards the project has upheld since day one. After a verification process, Nimiq Pay users on Android can make self-custodial NIM payments at any terminal where the NAKA Payment Network is already enabled. Fast, secure, and convenient!

## What Is NAKA?

NAKA is the world’s first blockchain-based card payment network aligned with EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) standards, ensuring compatibility with existing global card payment infrastructure. Functionally, it uses the same EMV technical framework adopted by major card networks, while introducing a decentralized settlement layer, self-custody, and crypto-native transaction logic. Beyond the network itself, NAKA provides businesses with a complete Fintech Suite for modernizing their payment operations, from accepting crypto payments on existing terminals to issuing their own virtual, self-custodial cards.

Because NAKA follows full EMV specifications, it integrates seamlessly into existing payment infrastructure without requiring structural changes. Any acquirer can enable NAKA through a simple software upgrade, meaning no new hardware, no additional devices, and no special merchant training.

## Nimiq & NAKA: A Partnership Years in the Making

The collaboration between Nimiq and NAKA goes back to early 2023, when NAKA still operated under its previous brand GoCrypto.

At the time, GoCrypto was already a pioneer in payment infrastructure, operating more than 750 crypto payment terminals in Slovenia’s capital Ljubljana alone, and over 3’500 across Europe in total. Their team had proven that crypto payments could be made compatible with existing retail systems, a vision that strongly resonated with Nimiq’s mission to make self-custodial crypto payments simple and widely accessible. But it wasn’t a given that the two projects would work together: The relationship developed gradually, through open conversations, mutual learning, and a shared belief in self-custody, crypto payment adoption and financial self-determination.

Through Nimiq’s commitment to self-custodial payments and NAKA’s goal of enabling crypto-native transactions in everyday commerce, we have reached a significant milestone: the introduction of Nimiq’s virtual self-custodial payment card in the Nimiq Pay App. This significantly increased NIM’s utility, extending it from a digital asset within the Nimiq ecosystem to one that can be used through a mainstream, card-native payment experience in everyday life.

As payments evolved, it became clear that true scalability would come from building on the legacy infrastructure the world already uses, extending it with new acceptance options that make crypto part of the same everyday flow. In a meeting some time later, **NAKA’s Founder and CEO, Dejan Roljić**, shared his vision of building a **blockchain-based card payment network** designed precisely for that purpose. His goal was to make crypto transactions so technically straightforward that any existing acquirer or payment provider could integrate them into their backend systems with minimal effort.

When the Nimiq team first tested the NAKA Card in Lugano in 2024, the experience confirmed what both projects had believed all along: this was the right direction for real-world crypto adoption. Today, Nimiq and NAKA continue to build on this shared foundation, combining NAKA’s decentralized card payment network with Nimiq’s self-custodial technology to make crypto payments as seamless and accessible as traditional ones. It’s a partnership built not only on shared technology, but on a shared belief in freedom, self-custody, simplicity, and long-term impact.

*“With the NIM-powered payment card, Nimiq didn’t just ship a feature, they showed what user-owned money looks like when it finally reaches everyday life. No buzzwords, no theory, just tap and go. This is the direction we believed in from day one of our collaboration nearly three years ago. Today feels big, but it’s nowhere near the ceiling.’’*

**Dejan Roljic**, CEO & Founder of NAKA

## Why Nimiq Card Support on iOS Is Still Limited

The Nimiq Card is currently supported on all compatible Android devices and will also be enabled on iOS for users with EU-based Apple IDs in the near future. Nimiq will keep users informed as new markets and device support go live.

## Up next: Expanding NIM Acceptance and Reach

Together with NAKA, we’re working to increase the number of acceptance points for NIM, helping our users experience self-custodial NIM payments in everyday life. Nimiq aims to make NIM spendable across an expanding set of acceptance networks. Priority regions include Latin America, supported by NAKA’s increasing infrastructure presence, and other markets outside Europe.

*"NAKA's EMV compatibility enables us to integrate the NAKA Payment Network into our existing network of payment partners and acquirers. This allows NIM payments to be accepted across more payment networks and locations, making the virtual Nimiq NAKA Card usable in an even broader ecosystem."*

## This is just the beginning!

The launch of the virtual Nimiq NAKA Card marks the beginning of a new chapter for Nimiq Pay. Together with NAKA, we’re bringing crypto payments closer to real-world utility, where every transaction is fast, convenient, and truly self-custodial.

In conjunction with the launch of the Nimiq’s Card inside Nimiq Pay, we’ve also made it much easier to explore the crypto world around you. There’s an all-new in-app navigation experience which makes it easy to find shops, restaurants and other places that already accept NAKA Card payments.

This update is just the beginning. It sets the stage for millions of additional acceptance locations Nimiq plans to unlock for real self-custodial crypto payments. The goal is simple; make getting around your (Crypto)city effortless, fast and fun, so you can easily discover new spots to spend your NIM!

We’re excited for what’s ahead and look forward to empowering NIM holders around the globe to enjoy a state-of-the-art crypto payment experience.
