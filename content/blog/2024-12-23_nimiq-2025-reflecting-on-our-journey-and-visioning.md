Nimiq has achieved a monumental milestone with the release of the eagerly anticipated upgrade to Proof of Stake. This key development has transformed Nimiq into a robust and efficient payment ecosystem with innovative features such as staking, minimal energy consumption, rapid payment transactions, and a performance level primed for global scale processing. With this final piece of the puzzle, the complete picture of a Payment Ecosystem is now fully outlined.

The journey to this point has been exhilarating and challenging, made possible by the unwavering support of everyone in the Nimiq community. As we stand at the threshold of 2025, we proudly recognize Nimiq as not only a ready-for-mass-adoption payment ecosystem but also as one of the most enduring payment projects within the cryptocurrency space.

## The Nimiq Payment Ecosystem

The Nimiq ecosystem now features a robust collection of tools designed to enable everyone to have non-custodial access for holding, sending, and receiving money through crypto payments. As these tools evolve, the ecosystem will become even more accessible, empowering non-tech-savvy users to easily start making payments with crypto. At the core is our non-custodial wallet, enabling every user to directly participate in and contribute to the network, bolstering security and decentralization. It also supports non-custodial swaps, allowing seamless transactions between NIM, BTC, and USDC/USDT on Polygon.

Complementing the wallet, our web-based Point of Sale system, accessible at[ cplink.com](http://cplink.com), facilitates easy and secure transactions for both merchants and consumers. The [Nimiq Pay](https://www.nimiq.com/nimiq-pay/) mobile app extends these capabilities, taking advantage of mobile native technology such as NFC and allowing users to effortlessly make payments in hundreds of thousands of stores globally by integrating different payment networks like Bitcoin Lightning. This is complemented by our [crypto map](https://map.nimiq.com/), which not only lists all the places where you can pay with crypto but also makes it easy for users to find these locations. These interconnected components are meticulously designed to support rapid, cost-effective, and eco-friendly transactions, paving the way for global adoption and broadening the utility of the NIM token.

In summary, the Team Nimiq took a first-principles thinking approach to thoroughly understand and address the fundamental needs of individuals in the realm of payments. Then developed an extensive suite of tools and services aimed at enabling true peer-to-peer non-custodial payments, thereby fulfilling Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision.

By tackling every facet of the payment process—from desktop and mobile transactions to merchant acceptance, store of value solutions, stablecoins, and high-performance payment coins—Nimiq ensures a fully decentralized and user-centric experience. This comprehensive strategy not only empowers users with complete control over their funds but also enhances accessibility and drives widespread adoption. Additionally, Nimiq’s commitment to eco-friendly and cost-effective transactions underscores its dedication to sustainable financial systems. Nimiq is setting a new standard for decentralized financial ecosystems, providing a seamless, secure, and efficient platform that meets the diverse needs of today’s users and paves the way for global financial inclusion.

## What’s Next? Broadening the Adoption of Crypto Payments

While Team Nimiq remains committed to enhancing and supporting the existing Nimiq Ecosystem, our focus pivots to widespread adoption. We aim to explore diverse use cases and niche markets where Nimiq can address real-world challenges, thereby broadening the utility and reach of the NIM token.

Stay tuned as we continue to share updates and developments. We invite every member of the Nimiq community to engage with us—contributing ideas and participating in brainstorming to amplify Nimiq’s visibility and impact.

As we venture into this promising future, we would like to end by taking a moment to appreciate our collective achievements and the exciting journey ahead.

Thank you for your continued support.

Pura Vida,

**Team Nimiq**
