This adds a new usecase to Nimiq Blockchain by resulting in an easy-to-use voting platform with a high level of transparency and decentralization since all votes are public, not controlled by any single individual/entity and will be stored in the Nimiq Blockchain for posterity.

The results are in for the tightly contested election for the Community Funding Board Representatives. Team Nimiq would like to thank all of the 113 members of the community who participated in the democratic process and to all the candidates who put themselves forward to represent our great community. Here is a time lapse of the voting process.

The voting process was held using a web application that records all votes on the Nimiq Blockchain. The voting app was built by Community Representative Chugwig and is hosted by both Chugwig and Smitop. This adds a new usecase to the Nimiq Blockchain by resulting in an easy-to-use voting platform with a high level of transparency and decentralization since all votes are public, not controlled by any single individual/entity and will be stored in the Nimiq Blockchain for posterity. Here is a summary of the final results:

With an incredible 773 million NIM being used in the voting process, the second term of the Community Funding Board sees **Mat, Chugwig, and Wekkel duly elected as community representatives for the next six months. The details of the elections are below:**

The remaining three Board seats will be taken by Richy, Sven, and Marvin from Team Nimiq.

We’d like to give special thanks to **Smitop and SirChef** for their service to the Nimiq community and the Board over the last six months. Thank you for your help in laying the foundations for future Boards to support even more Nimiq community projects. Your contribution to the numerous Nimiq projects that have been supported over the last six months has been priceless.

## The Meeting

Both previous and current community board members were present for the latest meeting to ensure a smooth transition between boards. The following topics were discussed:

- **What if a Board member submits a project proposal for funding? **It was decided that future board members would be eligible to submit a proposal for funding. However, they would not be able to vote on it themselves due to there being a conflict of interests. To bring the number of board votes back up to six, it was decided that an alumni board member would fill the empty seat for the purposes of voting.
- **Proactive outreach to existing Nimiq ecosystem projects. **The Board agreed to increase the scope of the Community Project Funding initiative by reaching out to existing Nimiq projects to offer technical, design and funding support. It was also agreed that those who are adding value to the Nimiq ecosystem will be sought out for rewards to recognize their efforts.
- **Small changes to future proposal submissions**. The Board discussed optimizing proposal submissions and decided that the ideal proposal would start out small to begin with, and that additional funding could be requested to add more features. It was also agreed that developer rewards should not take the form of one large figure. Instead, future proposals should include milestones for suggested developer rewards.

## Evaluated Projects

This month, two community projects were discussed:

### Vrimiq

- **Project purpose: **To create a Nimiq focused VR social space to bring Nimiq supporters together. VRimiq is envisioned to run directly in a browser on any device and with or without a VR-headset.
- **Development stage:** Concept.
- **Project team:** Telegram user arnputz.
- **Previously evaluated?** Yes.

The Board commented that not much had changed in the proposal since it was last evaluated. It was also noted that the more detailed breakdown for costs appeared to be too high. This was particularly true of the anticipated developer rewards. After all, the idea of the Community Funding Board is to reward creators in the Nimiq ecosystem and NOT employ subcontractors.

The Board requested modifications to be made. The developer reward is to be removed with a more modest reward suggested as the first step for this ambitious project. Arnputz has also been asked to outline how they envision the digital economy aspect of Vrimiq to work.

### Voting Celebration Giveaway

- **Project Purpose:** To reward those that participated in the first Community Funding Board election with a NIM airdrop.
- **Development stage: **Working product.
- **Project team: **Chugwig.
- **Previously evaluated?** No.

Chugwig proposed rewarding those that engaged in the latest Community Funding Board election in the following way:

- 1K NIM to each account that voted in the election (excluding accounts with a balance less than 5 NIM at block 679000).
- An extra 4000 NIM (totaling 5000 NIM) to accounts that voted in the election and the test vote.
- 500 NIM for accounts that participated in the test vote.

The Board approved the proposal provided that the 4K extra NIM reward was removed. Instead, those who vote in the election and test vote would be rewarded with 1.5K NIM total. This means that someone who voted in the test vote with account A and someone who voted in the real vote with account B won't get less than the person who voted in both votes with account C.
