description: Over the past months, we took a step back to examine the crypto landscape and our role within it, and began reshaping Nimiq’s path forward. Below you’ll find an honest look at where we stand, what we have learned, and how these insights are turning into concrete next steps.

With the launch of Nimiq’s Proof‑of‑Stake consensus last November, we crossed off the final item on the technical roadmap first sketched in our [2017](https://medium.com/nimiq/nimiq-a-peer-to-peer-payment-protocol-native-to-the-web-ffd324bb084) and [2020](https://www.nimiq.com/litepaper/) whitepapers. Building original technology took longer than anticipated, which kept us focused inward while the market changed around us. With the new core protocol complete, we shifted our attention to analyzing what would drive real-world traction and defining what comes next.

## Here’s What’s Been Going On

Following the PoS release and the smaller upgrades in its wake, we’ve spent the last few months taking the time to ask the harder questions. Given everything we’ve built, why hasn’t the market reflected these achievements? Why haven’t we been able to turn our strong tech, solid team, and healthy runway into real-world success?

What may have appeared like inactivity was, in fact, deep work, reflecting on the hard questions, challenging our own thinking, and laying the groundwork for a stronger, more adaptive Nimiq.

So let’s clear some things up:

## Quiet ≠ Gone

Nimiq remains healthily funded. Operating at arms-length, our treasury continues to be healthy and transparent, as demonstrated through our annual reports. These reports give you a detailed look at how funds are allocated. The next one, covering the 2024/25 cycle, is set to be published in August.

The team remains committed. Every engineer, designer, and contributor who shipped PoS remains with the project, looking to support what comes next. But even with the right people and a clear commitment, we recognize Nimiq needs more.

## Breaking the Echo Chamber

To challenge our perspective, we brought in two experienced advisors:

- [**Serotonin**](https://serotonin.co/), the marketing team behind Ethereum’s launch, helped us map out where crypto payments are, and where they’re heading.
- [**Jung von Matt**](https://www.jvm.com/), one of Europe’s top creative agencies, tested our messaging with real users and merchants to uncover how Nimiq is seen from the outside.

Our combined research confirmed what we were starting to suspect:

- For day-to-day payments, **stablecoins** are being used instead of volatile assets due to their ability to reduce complexity and risk. Stablecoins have achieved the highest level of crypto payment product market fit.
- Crypto users live in **multi‑chain** worlds. Utility must cross ecosystems, not stay fenced inside one chain.
- **Mobile first**. If it isn’t effortless on a phone, it isn’t used.

## So, What Are We Doing About It?

### Organizationally

We realized that our flat hierarchy, while great for fostering collaboration and agency, was making it harder to act quickly and efficiently.

So, we brought in professional help. We partnered with **OrgVolution**, specialists in organizational development, and went through a series of assisted workshops.

We set out to restructure our organization with four key goals in mind:

- Product ownership and accountability.
- Smarter, faster decision-making.
- KPIs that encourage everyone to stay sharp and adapt quickly.
- A culture of action over perfection.

This isn’t just cosmetic. It’s a fundamental shift in how we look to approach the future.

### Strategically

We refined our purpose and core principles. Now we’re focused on shaping what comes next for Nimiq.

Our top priority is to ensure that whatever we do serves the health of the Nimiq ecosystem and the NIM token. At the same time, we’re actively looking beyond the domain we’ve traditionally focused on. This means exploring innovative fields such as AI, Real-World Assets (RWA), DeFi, and Interoperability.

## What to expect

Clarity. Confidence. A Re-imagined Strategy.

As soon as possible, we will reveal** our new roadmap, along with a refreshed website and path forward.**

This strategic shift has been our main focus, but it has gone hand-in-hand with ongoing development. Several new features are getting ready to launch soon, including support for multisig transactions, a revamped developer center, tools for user feedback, a new private-key backup option for the Nimiq Wallet, and an improved staking user interface.

### Our commitment to NIM

Though our reflections challenge the status quo and broaden the scope of opportunities, there is one thing the project never questioned:

NIM is at the heart of Nimiq’s future.

We are 100% committed to the Nimiq Community. We deeply appreciate your support and participation and thank you for being on this journey with us. Your perspective matters! What do you think?
