Team Nimiq would like to extend special thanks to **[Terorie](https://github.com/terorie/)** and **[Vasconcelos](https://github.com/lucaslg26)**, both members of the Nimiq community, for their instrumental help in spearheading this new collaboration with **[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)**.

## Why collaborate with a multi-crypto wallet?

It’s no secret that the cryptocurrency universe is diverse and that many crypto holders own many different cryptocurrencies. Before multi-coin wallets like Trust Wallet, a crypto user might have to set up many different wallets to store their cryptocurrencies. This is not only time consuming but can be confusing, putting off many new potential crypto adopters.

There is nothing that can contribute to the mass adoption of cryptocurrency more than simplification and making crypto easy to use. Without this, crypto is unlikely to ever be mass adopted by the average person. An important step to achieve mass adoption and expand the crypto user-base is by making cryptocurrency more accessible to less tech-savvy users. Multi-coin wallets have already made a big contribution in increasing cryptos ease-of-use by enabling your typical user to easily store and track different crypto assets all in a single place.

Both Nimiq and Trust Wallet share a vision of simplifying cryptocurrency and there are a few reasons behind Nimiq pursuing this mutually beneficial collaboration.

- The community lead effort spearheaded by **[Terorie](https://github.com/terorie/) **and **[Vasconcelos](https://github.com/lucaslg26) **has empowered NIM holders by providing another great and convenient way to store tokens securely. Trust Wallet will also be the first mobile app to support NIM and enables Nimiq supporters to easily use NIM on the go.
- Nimiq is set to integrate the NIM faucet into the Trust Wallet multi-crypto app so that users can experience the simplicity of NIM for free.
- Adding NIM to the fastest growing multi-coin wallet increases the visibility and reach of Nimiq in the cryptocurrency community.
- Opens the door for research collaboration opportunities between the two projects.

## What does Nimiq bring to the table?

Trust Wallet founder Viktor Radchenko is excited about this new collaboration and recognizes Nimiq’s great potential. Integrating NIM as a supported crypto asset continues Trust Wallet’s trend of only supporting high-quality cryptocurrencies and the app is set to benefit from an increase in users from Nimiq’s rapidly growing community. The integration of the Nimiq faucet is also set to expand Trust Wallet’s growing range of features.

Viktor has also expressed a deep interest in Nimiq’s groundbreaking blueprint for the crypto-to-fiat bridge **[Nimiq OASIS](https://medium.com/nimiq-network/nimiq-makes-fiat-currencies-blockchain-compatible-7503096a6252)** which is being developed in collaboration with **WEG Bank AG** and **Agora.Trade**. This could potentially enable Trust Wallet to accept fiat currency deposits and withdrawals in the future. The disruptive potential of Nimiq OASIS lies in the solution being able to empower users to buy or sell crypto without:

- A centralized intermediary ever controlling the two assets being swapped.
- The private keys of the crypto asset ever leaving the owners possession.

Nimiq OASIS is scheduled to go live in Q4 2019 and could add additional features to Trust Wallet whilst eliminating the need for a payment processor and the fees associated. More on Nimiq OASIS can be found in our [previous blog post.](https://medium.com/nimiq-network/nimiq-makes-fiat-currencies-blockchain-compatible-7503096a6252)

**NIM token integration into Trust Wallet went live on March 27, 2019.**

Trust Wallet also supports staking, a DApp browser and marketplace, enabling users to buy and sell digital assets like a CryptoKitty.

## Two million NIM giveaway

To celebrate NIM’s integration into Trust Wallet, Nimiq will hold a special giveaway of 1’000 NIM to the first 1’000 new users who download the Trust Wallet app, add NIM support to their wallet and claim them. Thereafter, 100 NIM will be given away to an additional 10’000 new users. The start of the promotion and more details on how to claim will be announced on [Nimiq’s Twitter account](https://twitter.com/nimiq).

## By the community, for the community

We would like to give many thanks and credit to Nimiq community members **[Terorie](https://github.com/terorie/)** (Germany) and **[Vasconcelos](https://github.com/lucaslg26)** (Brazil) who are responsible for the majority of the development efforts on Trust Wallet integration. If you’re a developer new to Nimiq and want to join a rapidly growing multi-national community filled with highly skilled developers, then consider submitting a proposal to participate in our [Community Project Funding initiative.](https://medium.com/nimiq-network/community-project-funding-6a1f9ec3a16c) Maybe you’ll be lucky enough to even collaborate with Vasconcelos and Terorie.

Finally, the Nimiq Team would like to thank everyone in the Nimiq community for your amazing support. We are more dedicated than ever to expanding the Nimiq ecosystem and forging meaningful collaborations and partnerships with projects that share our ethos and values.
