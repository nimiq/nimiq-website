Today, we are opening a small three-part series marking the anniversary of Albatross! Just a year ago, the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake blockchain went live, and we are here to celebrate it.

Over the next days, we’ll revisit the tech behind Nimiq Proof-of-Stake and walk through how the monumental launch unfolded exactly one year ago. But before we get to those stories, we wanted to start with some big news: what we are sharing today.

We have three updates that have been in the works for a while:

- Multisig is now live
- A completely revamped Staking UI
- A refresh on our website’s narrative

Keep reading for a quick overview of each one and where you can try them.

## Multisig is Live

The Nimiq Multisig app is now available! It’s built to keep things simple to use while supporting secure shared ownership. The all new app lets you share a wallet with family, friends, business partners, and anyone you choose.

The idea is simple: a group controls a single wallet, and transactions only move when the required people approve them. You sign in with your Nimiq Wallet, create a Shared Wallet, choose how many participants and approvals are needed, and then invite others through a secure link. Once everyone joins, the wallet becomes active and can send and receive NIM. From there, anyone in the group can create a transaction, and all required signers can approve it using the Keyguard.

You can [try it out in the Multisig app](https://multisig.nimiq.com/)!

We also have a technical blog post coming soon that explains how the app works behind the scenes, for those who follow the protocol side of things.

## A New Staking UI

Our designers and frontend team have spent the past weeks improving the staking interface. The goal was to make it easier to navigate, give the layout more breathing room, and streamline common actions. The updated design focuses on clarity and removes small friction points that users shared with us along the way.

## Refreshing the Website’s Narrative

We’ve also revisited the wording on the website. This is a smaller update but one that still feels worth highlighting. The new text reflects where Nimiq is today and the direction we’re moving toward, so the landing page feels more aligned with the work we have been doing.

## What’s Next

This post is the opener for the anniversary series. Next, we will share the Multisig technical blog post, followed by the rest of the series. Stay tuned!

Pura Vida,

Team Nimiq
