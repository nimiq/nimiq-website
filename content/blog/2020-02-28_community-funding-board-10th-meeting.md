This month the Community Funding Board focused on rewarding the great work carried out by Nimiq community members and supporting the proactive initiatives suggested.

The time has also come to hold new elections to vote in the third round of community representatives. So, we’ll dive into all that and more in this blog post.

## What Went Down In The Meeting?

### Nimiq Memes

The Community Funding Board decided to support the [Nimiq Meme](https://twitter.com/NimiqMemes) Twitter account, which was an initiative started by one of our community members. The Board determined that a small proactive reward should be granted and that the new Twitter account would be given 30k NIM to be used for giveaways and further expand the reach of Nimiq Memes.

Thank you James, keep it going!

The Board also recognized that James Warren had become one of the most active posters in Nimiq’s Telegram group over the last three months. James had not only dedicated a lot of time into helping create a very positive vibe in Telegram by making it rain cashlinks, but he had also answered numerous questions from the community to a very high level indeed. The Community Funding Board decided that the time has come to recognize his efforts in the form of a small NIM reward and we certainly hope to continue seeing him around in Telegram for months to come.

In terms of ongoing community bounties, Nimiq has received Java and Go RPC client submissions. The core team already reviewed these and community bounties will be distributed for these providing they pass quality assurance tests during the review.

## New Community Funding Board Elections

_| Last election results_

Nimiq’s vision for the Community Funding Board is to work with three elected community representatives to determine which community initiatives to support and to act in the best interests of Nimiq’s expanding ecosystem. You could say that the ethos is ‘by the community, for the community’.

However, the term for current community representatives is coming to an end. We’d like to thank Matt, Wekkel and Chugwig for their service to the community over the last few months and announce that new Community Funding Board elections will be held.

### How To Put Yourself Forward As A Community Representative?

Anyone interested in having a deeper say in the Nimiq community and playing a critical role in Nimiq’s future should certainly consider putting themselves forward as a Community Representative candidate.

Team Nimiq recognizes that there are varied interests within the community and that’s why we’d ideally like a community representative from each of these interest groups:

- A crypto enthusiast
- A developer
- A crypto trader

This way we can better serve the overall community as a whole and do our best to ensure that the interests of everyone are represented.

If you think you are up to the challenge, then you should know that:

- Community representatives are not compensated for their role on the Board. Instead, this gives you the unique opportunity to shape the future of Nimiq and do so for the benefit of the Nimiq community as a whole.
- Board terms last 6 months.
- You will be required to attend one monthly meeting and coordinate with other Board members on Telegram/Discord.
- Be ready to attend the first Community Funding Board meeting (online) on Sunday, March 8 at 15:00 UTC

Sounds like something you want to be part of?

**Well, put yourself forward as a community representative candidate before midnight, March 2 UTC. **
