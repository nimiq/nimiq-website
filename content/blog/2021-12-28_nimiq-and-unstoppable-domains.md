Nimiq is happy to announce support for blockchain domain names powered by Unstoppable Domains. With this new partnership, Nimiq wallet users can send and receive crypto to user-friendly domain names such as ‘yourname.wallet’. Our goal with this step is bringing us closer to widespread adoption by lowering entry barriers to the crypto space and making it more accessible for all humans alike.

## Unstoppable Domains

Unstoppable Domains focuses on building NFT Domains. NFT Domains are web extensions (just like ‘.com’) launched as smart contracts on public blockchains. They are built on the idea of a decentralized internet, allowing users to be the sole owner of their domain with tags like .crypto, .wallet, and .nft.

Because your NFT Domain is an asset in the blockchain, it can be stored in your crypto wallet. This self-custodial aspect of NFT Domains gives them advantages over your common .com domains, for example:

- They work as usernames to replace all your wallets addresses for sending and receiving crypto
- They can host Decentralized Websites
- They can be used as a login for Dapps
- They can not be seized by third parties
- There are no renewal fees, ever.

## What does it mean for Nimiq users?

At Nimiq we believe in making instant digital payments simple and accessible for users of all levels.
