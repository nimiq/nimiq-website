  content: |-
    Nimiq develops innovative easy-to-use software (tech/technology/tools/applications) that helps humanity transition into the next generation of finance: a sustainable monetary system where intermediaries are not part of commerce, where people are always in full control of their own money, can use it globally and profit from it to achieve financial freedom.

    Therefore, Nimiq is building a self-custodial, non-discriminatory, easily usable, secure, cheap, eco-friendly and collaborative decentral financial ecosystem including a digital currency, fast payments, cheap remittances and passive income available to everyone.

    Nimiq (NIM) is neutral independent money for a new generation of global collaboration: Free and easy to use for everyone, open for everyone to participate and contribute and interoperable with the future standards of finance.
