        ## What is it about?![](https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/nimiq/91319641-44e4-40c1-8471-7051cc077e6d_what-is-it-about.svg)

        It is about earning crypto instead of buying it. By accepting BTC, ETH or NIM for your effort/service, you get a piece of the future and widen your audience. The payment is purely peer-to-peer, that means it goes from the paying persons crypto wallet directly to yours, without a middleman and completely for free.

        It is for all small business owners and freelancers who are open to accepting crypto payments. Think about diversifying your income directly. Instead of only getting paid in USD, EUR, etc, take a fraction of your income in crypto and hold it. A great alternative to opening an exchange account, transfering USD and trading into crypto.
