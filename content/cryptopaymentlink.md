        ### What is it about?

        ![](/assets/images/prismic/91319641-44e4-40c1-8471-7051cc077e6d_what-is-it-about.svg)

        It is about earning crypto instead of buying it. By accepting BTC, ETH or NIM for your effort/service, you get a piece of the future and widen your audience. The payment is purely peer-to-peer, that means it goes from the paying persons crypto wallet directly to yours, without a middleman and completely for free.

        ### Who is it for?

        ![](/assets/images/prismic/4ce47827-0b27-4235-b2ad-73bec75b655e_who-is-it-for.svg)

        It is for all small business owners and freelancers who are open to accepting crypto payments. Think about diversifying your income directly. Instead of only getting paid in USD, EUR, etc, take a fraction of your income in crypto and hold it. A great alternative to opening an exchange account, transfering USD and trading into crypto.
