    <h1 class="content card-title">KYC Procedure, Data Collection and Retention</h1>
    <div class="content card">
      <p>
        As part of the NIM Activation, Nimiq Network Ltd. ("Nimiq") conducts a KYC Procedure to help ensure regulatory
        compliance and adapt Genesis Block NIM to international standards. Since data protection is of a particularly
        high priority for us, we would like to inform you of the exact nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data
        we collect, use and process.
      </p>

      <p>
        All personal data gathered by Nimiq during the KYC Procedure ("Personal Information") will only be used to
        identify and verify your identity. As part of the KYC Procedure, Nimiq will collaborate with Intrum Justitia AG,
        Eschenstrasse 12, CH-8603 Schwerzenbach, Switzerland; Jumio Corporation, 268 Lambert Avenue, Palo Alto, CA
        94306, US; and IVXS Technology USA Ltd, 85 Broad St, NY 10004, US ("ComplyAdvantage") (collectively "Service
        Providers"). All Service Providers have provided sufficient guarantees to meet all applicable regulatory
        requirements and will only process your Personal Information on servers situated within the European Union (for
        further reference see
        <a
          href="https://www.jumio.com/legal-information/privacy-policy/jumio-inc-privacy-policy-for-online-services/"
          target="_blank"
          >Jumio Data Privacy Policy</a
        >
        and <a href="https://go.online-ident.ch/privacy/en" target="_blank">Intrum Data Privacy Policy</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Nimiq will transfer your Personal Information to either Intrum Justitia or Jumio. They will be responsible for
        the identification and verification of your identity and will ask you to provide a photograph or videofeed of
        your passport and face ("Verification Information"). After their verification Procedure, Intrum Justitia or
        Jumio will provide to Nimiq a copy of the Verification Information and will retain the Personal Information and
        the Verification Information for a period of 180 days (Intrum Justitia) or 12 months (Jumio), respectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the verification procedure is successful, Nimiq will then send your full name and birth date to
        ComplyAdvantage to perform a Global Sanctions, Watchlist and Politically Exposed Persons check to ensure that
        you are not prohibited from participating in the NIM Activation. ComplyAdvantage does not retain any of the
        Personal Information obtained by Nimiq.
      </p>

      <p>
        After successfully passing the ComplyAdvantage check, Nimiq will send you an email containing instructions on
        how to activate your NIM. The Personal Information and Verification Information will be encrypted by Nimiq and
        stored with ISO 27001 certified hosts in Germany or Switzerland for a period of up to 10 years. This allows
        Nimiq to demonstrate to regulators that the KYC Procedure was implemented. Nimiq will delete all non-encrypted
        data within 48 hours after sending the acceptance email.
      </p>

        <a href="https://www.nimiq.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, consult with your personal advisors,
