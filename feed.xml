            <description><![CDATA[New report for the period following July 2024]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In line with the last report, we would like to present an updated overview of the assets and use of funds for the Nimiq project, as well as updated details of the distribution of NIM tokens and the circulating supply. The period covered since the last report is August 1, 2024 through July 31, 2025. The report indicates a slightly increased burn-rate in-line with expectations, as well as a fair increase in net assets due to favorable crypto market value developments and diversification. Assets and use of funds Assets The Nimiq Project continues to hold a variety of liquid and non-liquid assets. German TEN31 (WEG) Bank AG drew down on a pre-approved equity capital increase which reduced the relative Nimiq holdings to 7.17%. The new shares were issued at par value resulting in no change in expected value of shares held by Nimiq. Similarly, the real estate holdings were unchanged based on current market value estimates. As of publication of the report the Nimiq Project had the following assets: 89.5 BTC ~ US$ 9.93 Mio 929.36 ETH ~ US$ 4.08 Mio 132.0 Mio NIM (besides genesis NIM) ~ US$ 92K EUR, USD & USDC ~ US$ 1.31 Mio Stake in TEN31 (WEG) Bank ~ US$ 2.20 Mio (unchanged from 2024) Real Estate ~ US$ 2.00 Mio (unchanged from 2024) Loan to ImpactX Foundation: ~ US$ 33.8K Reserves (see "Use of funds") ~ US$ (-0.1 Mio) Total Net Assets: ~US$ 19.54 Mio Use of funds The use of funds from the end of July 2024 up to the end of July 2025 breaks down as follows: Product Development Contracting, Compensations: This includes all research, design, implementation and maintenance work regarding the Nimiq protocol and its switch from Proof-of-work to Proof-of-stake, Cryptopayment Link, Crypto Map, the iOS and Android Nimiq Pay Apps, the Nimiq Wallet and other related apps and systems. The report indicates a modest US$ 6.8K per contractor per month, reflecting a relative small increase in contracting expenses mostly due to inflation adjustments. The achievement of the development goal (release of Proof of Stake for Nimiq in November 2024) unlocked the pending dues from delayed compensations, which were paid out from the reserves carried forward since 2020 (~US$ 260K) with a net-zero effect for this reporting period. ~US$ 2’190.3K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~52.6% of total (~60.5% of non-extraordinary)  Marketing, Content, Community: This category covers expenses related to educational content production (video, written, and visual), branding initiatives, sponsorships, merchandise, user research, community project grants, rewards-based campaigns, social media management, and participation in industry conferences. It also includes support for regional adoption initiatives such as the European Kryptostadt, Latin American Criptociudad and Gambian Cryptocity programs, which fall under the broader "Cryptocity" adoption campaigns aimed at facilitating partnerships and driving network effects that promote real-world use of NIM. Ongoing community engagement and security initiatives are also accounted for, including the Bug Bounty Program, with a reserve of US$ 100K allocated for the next 12 months. ~US$ 759.4K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~18.2% of total (~21.0% of non-extraordinary)
 Legal, Administration, Taxes: This includes legal, tax and administrative expenses regarding corporate maintenance, contract review, accounting, professional support from Lara Legal Corp, Mathys & Squire, Annerton Rechtsanwälte, and additional task specific international legal counsel i.e. for pursuing required licenses, trademarking, terms of services, privacy policies, legal memorandums, etc. The increased cost reflects the trademark efforts around protecting NIM, Nimiq and Cryptocity immaterial assets in various languages and jurisdictions, as well as legal opinions for and reviews of the many requirements for the Bluecode and Naka collaborations. ~US$ 252.4K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~6.1% of total (~7.0% of non-extraordinary)
 Digital Operations, Equipment: This includes expenses related to hosting, hardware, software, licensing, communications, domains, and other development tools and platforms. The decrease in this position is mainly due to lower hosting costs resulting from the switch of Proof-of-Work to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism of the Nimiq Protocol.  ~US$ 146.2K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~3.5% of total (~4.0% of non-extraordinary)
 Travel, F&B: This includes expenses related to transportation, hotel, food/beverage, and hackathons. These expenses have held steady but can be expected to increase moderately based on general inflation of costs of travel and accommodation and plans to expand team presence at industry events. ~US$ 148.9K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~3.6% of total (~4.1% of non-extraordinary)
 Physical Operations, Rent: This includes expenses related to workspace, operational security, hackathon accommodation, and maintenance. Expenses in this category decreased noticeably due to cost efficiencies in the operating and maintenance of the workspaces and hackathon locations. ~US$ 124.5K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~3.0% of total (~3.4% of non-extraordinary)  Extraordinary: This includes fees for integrations on MEXC, Lunu, Coinify and stakingrewards.com, as well as market liquidity provision and funds for the PoS prestaking campaign. ~US$ 545.2K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~13.1% of total  Total Use of Funds: ~US$ 4’167.1K (US$ 3’621.9K non-extraordinary)  The monthly burn-rate average comes in at ~US$ 302K (excluding extraordinary expenses). The increase is mostly attributable to more average monthly spending on Marketing, Content, Community associated with the release of the Proof-of-Stake upgrade and the communication and campaign efforts around it. The project continued to support the growth of open efforts such as the European “Kryptostadt”, Latin American “Criptociudad” and “Cryptocity” efforts in Gambia. Efforts included creating awareness around the native Nimiq Pay iOS and Android apps that support paying with NIM wherever Bitcoin Lightning is accepted, to this day, an industry breakthrough. With increasing activities targeting the adoption of the “NIM <> BTC <> USD Stable Coin Trinity” in the payment acceptance and crypto holding process, as well as the staking of NIM, we expect a continued significant effort in that expense category going forward. As expected, total expenses related to Product Development Contracting, Compensations only increased slightly. Last year's report projected that the long-standing team has reached a level of quality and capacity such that no significant further hires were anticipated. Expenses related to Legal, Administration, Taxes, increased slightly as trademark efforts around Cryptocity and the legal umbrella for the merchant payment scheme partnerships are being pursued. The slight decrease in Digital Operations, Equipment is attributable to lower hosting costs. Travel, F&B and Physical Operations, Rent have held steady or decreased. The outlook for the former may point towards an increase here as the project will look to attend more industry events for positioning and visibility. NIM supply and distribution This second part describes the distribution of NIM tokens, showing details of accounts and vesting contracts as well as the circulating and total supply as of the end of July. Quick view Live summary of NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply.txt The total final NIM supply over ~100 years by design of the Nimiq Blockchain protocol (see Nimiq Whitepaper 2.0): 21'000'000'000 NIM. The circulating supply as of the end of July was ~13’283’569’946 NIM (~63.3% of final total). Details NIM activated from Token Sale NET (5% of final total): As of the end of July 2025, 861’049’052 NIM have been activated from NET and are part of the circulating supply. The remaining difference (~188’950’948 NIM) that has not been activated from NET is visible at account addresses NQ69 9A4A MB83 HXDQ 4J46 BH5R 4JFF QMA9 C3GN, NQ15 MLJN 23YB 8FBM 61TN 7LYG 2212 LVBG 4V19 and NQ17 YTX4 X5U6 5BUX HN5J V6VV 260V 9UP1 D39S. Though the deadline for activating NIM has long passed, Nimiq is processing requests on a case by case, manual basis (applying the same conditions of KYC/AML). Being conservative, Nimiq considers them part of the circulating supply. All other NIM are either acquired through mining (before the update to Proof-of-Stake), staking (since the update to Proof-of-Stake) or released through a vesting contract as further described below (all vesting durations are measured from April 14 2018).  NIM min(t)able (88% of final total): 18'480'000'000 NIM over ~100 years since April 2018. Up to the protocol upgrade in November 2024 from its Proof-of-Work to its new Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism 10’373’109’654 NIM were mined as block rewards. Since then an additional ~677’768’145 NIM have been minted from staking rewards for a total of ~11’050’877’799 NIM (~52.6% of final total) as of the end of July. Per vote from the community, miners and validators through adoption, the original emission curve was modeled to be unchanged and continuous from PoW to PoS.
 Nimiq Foundation (Project, 2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ09 VF5Y 1PKV MRM4 5LE1 55KV P6R2 GXYJ XYQF. Vesting is 26'250'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 367’500’000 NIM (1.75% of final total) are available and part of the circulating supply. These funds have not been spent to date. The majority of that amount, 341’250’000 NIM, is locked for staking as part of securing the Nimiq PoS network.  ImpactX Foundation (Charity, 2% of final total): 420'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ19 YG54 46TX EHGQ D2R2 V8XA JX84 UFG0 S0MC. Vesting is 21'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 294’000’000 NIM (1.4% of final total) are available and part of the circulating supply. These funds have not been spent to date. The majority of that amount, 273’000’000 NIM, is locked for staking as part of securing the Nimiq PoS network. In June 2021 a US$ 33’780 (1 BTC) donation was made to the charity: water’s bitcoin trust with an interest-rate-free loan from Nimiq to the ImpactX Foundation.  Nimiq Team & Early Contributors (2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at 82 vesting contract addresses, see https://pastebin.com/raw/1eDwDF45. Vesting schedule A (for creators) was 35'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 3 years and vesting schedule B was 157'500'000 NIM month 3 and month 6 (team, early contributors and future team member allocation).

            <description><![CDATA[Putting our treasury where our conviction is, effective immediately.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In our last community update we spoke about the transformation underway at Nimiq and we reaffirmed our commitment to NIM. Today we are following through in a simple and deliberate way. We are launching the NIM Treasury Accumulation Plan, an ongoing program to accumulate NIM from the open market into treasury reserves. This is not a grand reveal. It is a practical step that aligns our balance sheet with where the project is heading. Why we are doing this NIM sits at the center of what we are building, so our treasury should reflect that center of gravity. Accumulating NIM in the reserve is a straightforward way to align our balance sheet with our direction and to be prepared for the next phase of the project. It sets us up to design token mechanics from a position that matches our focus, and it expresses long‑term alignment without any need for big statements. We also want to be clear about context. Broader market sentiment has been healthy while sentiment around NIM has lagged. The thoughtful response is not spectacle but consistency. A disciplined accumulation plan signals where we stand, supports better economic design over time, and allows us to keep building while the treasury quietly moves into a posture that fits our ambitions. How the plan works The guidance is clear: permission and intention to purchase up to 5% of circulating NIM with a budget of $1MM USD over an initial six month window. The plan takes effect as of the publication of this post. Pacing will remain disciplined and may adapt to conditions. Purchases will follow a steady cadence that avoids predictability. Most of the time we will accumulate in smaller clips spread out over time. We will not publish a price ceiling. Public ceilings invite gaming and they tend to distort books around a single level. We do maintain internal guardrails and we will continue to review them as the market evolves. Funds will be converted from our existing treasury, which already includes a mix of crypto assets and stable assets. Acquired NIM will be held as a long term treasury reserve in visible addresses. Transparency and custody Transparency matters and execution quality matters as well. To balance the two, we will report after the fact. As applicable, we will publish a short disclosure that includes cumulative totals and an average purchase price range. We will maintain a reference list of the treasury addresses that hold the accumulated NIM. Many treasury addresses are already public, and we will add the new reserve addresses to that list so anyone can verify balances.  We are intentionally avoiding real time disclosure. Real time signals can be used to front run or lean against the program, and they are not required to achieve the transparency the community rightly expects. You will still have a clear picture of what was accumulated and where it sits. What this is, and what it is not This is straightforward treasury management that aligns reserves with strategy. It is not a mechanism to engineer market outcomes, and it is not a promise about future price or returns. Markets move for many reasons and our job is to build valuable things while stewarding the treasury responsibly. We also want to clarify language. It is common to call any program like this a buyback. In traditional finance that word is often tied to the retirement of shares. In crypto it is sometimes used for burns. That is not what we are doing. We are increasing the NIM allocation in the treasury, holding it in reserve, and disclosing our approach. The label is less important than the policy, and the policy is designed to be measured, auditable, and aligned with the road ahead. What to expect next The plan is live as of today. You will see the first disclosure soon, which will include totals to date and the addresses holding the purchased NIM. Beyond that, we remain focused on building, and this plan ensures that our treasury keeps pace with that focus.  Important notice This announcement describes a treasury allocation policy. It is not investment advice, a prediction of future performance, or an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any asset. The authorization is capped and discretionary. Timing, size, venues, and execution methods may vary based on market conditions and internal risk controls. We make no commitments regarding price, returns, or market impact. Purchases will be conducted in accordance with applicable requirements and good faith market practices.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Reporting for the period of August 28 to Sept 30, 2025]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Overview In line with our ongoing NIM Treasury Accumulation Plan announced on August 28, 2025, this brief disclosure summarizes NIM accumulation activity, key statistics, and transparency commitments, including cumulative totals and the average purchase price range for the period of September 2025. Program Recap The NIM Treasury Accumulation Plan authorizes purchasing up to 5% of the circulating NIM supply over a six-month period with a budget capped at $1 million USD. Purchases are deliberately paced over time to avoid predictability, with no public price ceiling, but internal guardrails ensure disciplined execution. Funds originate from existing treasury reserves. All acquired NIM is held in publicly verifiable addresses. Future reports will continue to provide regular updates on the progress of this plan. It is important to emphasize that the accumulation plan does not constitute investment advice or a forecast regarding the future price of NIM. Activity from September 2025 Total NIM Acquired:  98’373’000 Average Price: $  0.0006759 per NIM USD Spent: $  66’490 % of Circulating Acquired:   0.73% Reporting Period: August 28 — Sept 30, 2025 The following addresses currently hold project-acquired NIM and can be audited by the public: NQ63 SX1R 3UTB 8KD8 A0CV PDF2 J0VC UGUB 3HH0  Transparency & Custody We plan on issuing a report like this monthly until the end of the accumulation period, providing regular, transparent updates on the progress of the NIM Treasury Accumulation Plan. This announcement describes a treasury allocation policy and is not investment advice, a prediction of future performance, or an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any asset. The authorization is capped and discretionary. Timing, size, venues, and execution methods may vary based on market conditions and internal risk controls. We make no commitments regarding price, returns, or market impact. All purchases will be conducted in accordance with applicable requirements and good faith market practices. Beyond accumulation activities, we remain focused on building and ensuring our treasury keeps pace with the project’s long-term vision.

            <description><![CDATA[The “Blue Curve” won the vote and what this means for Nimiq]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq stakeholders started voicing their opinions regarding the possible need to make adjustments to the NIM supply curve and its inflation towards the end of last year. After hearing the concerns and researching the matter in depth, Team Nimiq implemented a voting procedure to ensure the decision process was going to be democratic, transparent, and educated. On June 8 2020, a decision was reached through this process: the "Blue Curve" came out ahead by a large margin in a final vote in which more than 1.27 billion NIM were signed for. You can find the results here. If you want to learn more about the process that brought us here, you can read the following resources: Nimiq 2.0 Supply Curve Considerations: Team Nimiq introduced their thoughts and suggestions on making adjustments to the coin supply curve for the switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Nimiq 2.0. Community AMA: Active discussion of the topic with Team members and the Nimiq Community in an AMA held in the Nimiq Forum Nimiq 2.0 Supply Curve Voting: Introduces the overall decision making plan, detailing the suggested NIM supply curve options ("Green", "Blue" and "Red") and the different possible voting scenarios and rounds. Nimiq 2.0 Supply Curve Voting Procedure: Describes the specific procedural timelines and applicable requirements for each voting phase as well as how to use the on-chainVoting App that was developed to allow easy and transparent voting for Nimiq Stakeholders.  The NIM Supply Curve for Nimiq 2.0 (aka "Blue Curve") The "Blue Curve" had been labeled "the balanced one" since its characteristics struck a good balance between the other suggested options. This curve followed from community suggestions and appears to be an adequate compromise between initial scarcity and reward amounts and how these evolve in time. It provides a healthy, while competitive, initial staking reward rate range of 8.3%-5.5% for the network staking ratio range of 50%-75%.  Depending on the actual timing of the switch to PoS and Nimiq 2.0, the first year NIM supply growth (inflation) will be around ~4.1% and the reward will average around ~517 NIM per minute. The initial stock-to-flow ratio then comes to ~24. The total NIM emission/reward decreases by 1.47% every year. If you want to look at numbers yourself, you can use this spreadsheet. Below is a table summarizing the timeline characteristics of the NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0.  Next Steps With the NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0 determined, Team Nimiq can finish implementing a staking calculator so current and potential new stakeholders can already do their own calculations and projections regarding upcoming staking. This also means Nimiq 2.0 can be picked up by popular staking reward listings on data driven Proof-of-Stake sites for visibility of Nimiq and comparison with existing staking coins.  Most importantly, we continue our path to Nimiq 2.0 by working on the PoS Albatross Testnet and planning the switching (fork) process. With the clarity of knowing which emission curve to transition to in Nimiq 2.0, the team can apply this decision to all aspects of development and communication. More information regarding the roadmap to Nimiq 2.0, and the actions that need to be taken by miners and pool operators to switch to validators for staking, will be released in time. Last not least a big thank you to our amazing community and all stakeholders that participated in making this important decision. The most exciting times are ahead of us! Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[December 2020]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lots of advances have been made since the last progress report, so we want to provide you with the latest updates. Here is a quick summary of some important milestones achieved during 2020, followed by particular details about the work done over the recent number of months: Launch of Cryptopayment.link: Don’t buy crypto, earn it! The easiest way for freelancers, influencers, owners of small businesses and rental companies to start accepting crypto for their work. Learn more about it in this dedicated blog post. Nimiq 2.0 Supply Curve Voting: In preparation for Nimiq 2.0, and based on the numerous requests from the community to review this matter, we followed a careful process that started by sharing our thoughts and suggestions on making adjustments to the coin supply curve for the switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Nimiq 2.0. We then discussed it with the community and hosted an AMA. Afterwards we communicated how the voting process would work and built a Voting Tool based on the Nimiq Blockchain. The first vote concluded May 18, 2020 with "YES" on making an adjustment to the NIM supply curve. See the results here. The follow-up ranking vote concluded on June 8, 2020 and the NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0 has been determined as the "BLUE" curve - a curve suggested by the community as the middle ground of the two curves suggested by Team Nimiq. See results here. Cutting-edge work on zero knowledge proof and nano nodes: One of the big strengths of Nimiq are the nano nodes and how they allow anyone to sync and connect to the blockchain from a regular or mobile browser in just a few seconds. Nano syncing in Nimiq 1.0 worked by leveraging two technologies: light clients and NiPoPoWs. Nimiq 2.0 will leverage ZPKs (zkSNARKs to be precise) to sync in seconds while reducing the amount of data that a user needs to download. We wrote an in-depth explanation for all those interested, which can be found in two blog posts here and here. Release of the Albatross Demonet: The Blockchain team has been focusing this year on the launch of the new Proof-Of-Stake consensus algorithm coinvented by Nimiq, called Albatross. One of the first milestones of this major goal was the release of the DemoNet and the accompanying informative site. At this site users can see a real life network of virtual servers running from different locations of the world and reaching over 1000 TPS with an average of 1 second confirmations. Release of Nimiq OASIS informative site: As work on OASIS moves ahead, we created this page on our website as a marketing effort to give a source-of-truth to people interested in integrating and writing about OASIS. Release of Fastspot: The first version of Fastspot was released, allowing the very first non-custodial euro-crypto swaps. The service is currently in a closed beta, we shared a video demo of how the swap works and looks. Release of Fastspot website: Powered by OASIS, Fastspot is a technology service built by Nimiq that allows users to perform non-custodial swaps of monetary, crypto and general off-chain assets. The site will allow users to use the service and also understand more about what it is, what are its benefits and what is yet to come. Progress details for the last few months The progress is divided amongst Team Nimiq’s internal sub-teams.  Front-end Team | Lead: Sören, development: Matheo, Daniel and Sven BTC Support: The recently released BTC support took most of August and September to be implemented. As NIM and BTC work very differently and Nimiq being much more developer friendly, the BTC integration was more challenging. A specific example is the way the wallet queries the balance of BTC in comparison to Nimiq. For BTC it is necessary to get all unspent outputs across all used addresses and calculate the balance, whereas in Nimiq querying the balance is a single network request. The final implementation takes advantage of the Electrum network powering the Electrum wallet. The Front-end Team ended up reading source code of various libraries and reverse engineering APIs since documentation was limited and there is no Bitcoin dev center. As an interesting note, the work done supports the latest segwit addresses (native segwit) only, reducing overhead a lot, making the implementation future-proof, and minimizing Bitcoin network fees. This decision is strongly supported by the fact that BTC core uses native segwit by default now also. Polishing Fastspot API: A first version of the Fastspot API was already ready by the time Front-end started implementing the swap into the Nimiq Wallet. However using the API extensively by connecting it to the Wallet revealed room for improvements in terms of documentation and general usability. As a result, the API is much more developer friendly now, the documentation is still work in progress based on the lessons learned. We are working on releasing the Fastspot API and a first client-library soon. Stay tuned. Swap integration: After BTC support was added to the wallet, Front-end focused on integrating Fastspot-based swaps. This new feature brought a lot of details, edge cases, and a complex UI implementation that we needed to make sure worked on all devices. We are very proud of the end results which you can use right now in the Nimiq wallet. New languages: Frontend Team, together with the help of community translators, released the wallet in 3 new languages: Russian, German and Spanish. Bitcou Voucher Store: Frontend team has been helping the developer behind Miqslist and Nimiq Video Game Store to bring a new shop to life: the Nimiq Voucher Store, a shop powered by Bitcou’s coupons. This store will allow you to use your NIM to buy in a big number of stores around the world. Next goals ahead: The Front-end Team is working towards the release of the fiat to crypto swap. In parallel they are also working on creating a Fastspot widget that will allow third-party projects to integrate Fastspot easily in their apps and websites. While these tasks are being completed, work is already on the way adding ETH to Fastspot. Blockchain Team | Lead: Philipp, research: Bruno and Pascal, development: Janosch, Sebastian, Jeffrey and Sergio Checkpoint blocks The blockchain team has been working in a new hierarchy of blocks for Albatross: Election blocks Checkpoint blocks Micro blocks  The previous Albatross design involved two types of blocks: micro blocks that contain transactions and macro blocks that provide finality and determine a new set of validators. "Finality" means that transactions can't be changed or reversed anymore. It is desirable that transactions reach finality fast in order to provide certainty for the recipient. On the other hand, changing the set of validators too frequently is problematic because it slows down the syncing process in two ways: it’s computationally expensive to create new election blocks and all election blocks need to be downloaded for a full sync, thus, more blocks means more time to sync. To improve both aspects at the same time, the blockchain team replaced macro blocks with check-point blocks and election blocks. Checkpoint blocks only provide finality while election blocks additionally also determine a new validator set. Checkpoint blocks will be built approximately every 5 minutes and thus transactions will quickly reach finality. Election blocks will be built approximately every 12 hours and thus pave the path for fast syncing. History tree This milestone has been Pascal’s focus for the last couple of months. When Nimiq nodes are downloading the history of the blockchain, they are interested in the state changes while avoiding syncing all micro blocks which would result in high download sizes. The new history tree allows nodes to download verifiable chunks from peers. Currently, the block hash is a tree that includes the transaction hashes. The new history tree is a tree structure which contains all the state changes that become part of the election block. A node then only needs an election block and the path in the tree to prove a transaction is part of it; so you only download chunks and a cryptographic proof. The history tree uses MMR (Merkle Mountain Ranges) and is an append only data-structure, but efficiently and fastly appended. Being cutting-edge technology, there was no library available to draw on. Instead, the team had to implement MMRs themselves and by doing so contributed to the open-source cryptocurrency world. History sync Also part of Pascal’s work. As previously discussed, the history tree is a data structure that contains the history of the blockchain. The history sync process downloads blocks and data from the history tree. To further optimize this operation, Pascal created an efficient way to download all the smaller data structures that compose the History tree. History sync is performed in an orderly fashion, first election blocks, then check-point blocks. Tendermint and Handel This milestone is brought to you by Sebastian and Bruno. As you might know, Tendermint is a BFT protocol to get consensus. Previously the team started out by using pBFT but then decided to go for Tendermint since pBFT had certain limitations when used in a blockchain. Together with the switch to Tendermint, Handel had to be adapted as well. As Janosch explains in this video, Handel is a signature aggregation protocol that, as the name states, aggregates and broadcasts signatures. As Nimiq 2.0 will have 512 validators, having all of them communicating between each other is not efficient. The solution is to group validators so that messages are shared between groups, where each group already aggregates signatures of validators within that group before sharing it with other groups. This method reduces bandwidth usage and improves propagation speed. And on top of that, Handel is a generic protocol which will also help optimizing view changes in Nimiq 2.0.  LibP2P Sergio and Janosch have teamed up for this work. Since August they have been carefully replacing the current network implementation of Nimiq 1.0 with LibP2P. This takes advantage of the big work done by Protocol Labs on LibP2P. They are using the Rust implementation of LibP2P and, since it is not custom made for Nimiq, they are adapting peer scoring to fit our needs. A big part of this task is done, such as completing the network interface, now the integration process has started. OASIS Amongst other things, Philipp has been preparing the OASIS (Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme) implementation for a use case that we have noticed could be very interesting: using OASIS for OTC platforms. In general this includes OASIS allowing OTC desks to authenticate and set specific fees and limits for their clients. The next tasks include integrating the official TEN31 (WEG Bank) escrow bank account, setting up production infrastructure and writing very detailed documentation to be ready for audits by German authorities. The documentation topic is extremely important because OASIS is using a regulated entity, namely TEN31 Bank. To comply with regulations there are no necessary changes in the code, but actually in the documentation and the processes. The final set-up effort of OASIS lies in extremely high up-time/availability of the service to ensure atomic swaps working successfully. This will include tests with the real infrastructure when ready. Improved RPC server Janosch has been working on this specific task. The latest RPC server version now supports web sockets, allowing events to get pushed and arrive via subscriptions instead polling which results in being much more efficient. This effort is still a work in progress and has low priority since the current focus is on the Albatross Aurora Testnet. Code clean-up and removing 1.0 code The initial idea of the Blockchain team was to have the client be able to communicate with 1.0 and 2.0 nodes for transition purposes, but in August that turned out to not be viable and resulted in the publication of a new transition plan. The conclusion is that the code of Nimiq 1.0 in Albatross is now unnecessary and can be removed to make the codebase more clean and lean. Refactoring the observable pattern to using streams The entire blockchain team has changed the way they are coding Nimiq 2.0. Nimiq 1.0 was originally written in JavaScript which is event driven. The initial implementation of Rust was following the same approach. But Rust has more efficient structures called “streams” that avoid “event-hell”, streamline code and make debugging much easier. They follow the schema of "producer ➜ stream ➜ consumer" - "receive a micro block ➜ add it to your data, see if you’re the next validator ➜ reply to the network". This results in a clean and linear process, making the code simpler and the maintenance easier while also allowing for more advanced features to be implemented that were not possible with the observable pattern. Most of the effort is done already and further updates in this direction will be done on the fly whenever other parts of the code are changed. Conclusion Some tasks have been harder than expected. Working with innovative cutting-edge technology is always a moving target and challenges us with unknown unknowns which we tackle as they reveal themselves. This has resulted in some unexpected delays but a lot of progress has been made. Team Nimiq stays focused on delivering the next version of Nimiq and the new exciting products built around Nimiq OASIS. As always we appreciate having such a great community on our side accompanying us on this journey. Go Nimiq!  Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[With the launch of  Nimiq’s Proof‑of‑Stake consensus last November, we crossed off the final item on the technical roadmap first sketched in our 2017 and 2020 whitepapers. Building original technology took longer than anticipated, which kept us focused inward while the market changed around us. With the new core protocol complete, we shifted our attention to analyzing what would drive real-world traction and defining what comes next. Here’s What’s Been Going On Following the PoS release and the smaller upgrades in its wake, we’ve spent the last few months taking the time to ask the harder questions. Given everything we’ve built, why hasn’t the market reflected these achievements? Why haven’t we been able to turn our strong tech, solid team, and healthy runway into real-world success? What may have appeared like inactivity was, in fact, deep work, reflecting on the hard questions, challenging our own thinking, and laying the groundwork for a stronger, more adaptive Nimiq. So let’s clear some things up: Quiet ≠ Gone Nimiq remains healthily funded. Operating at arms-length, our treasury continues to be healthy and transparent, as demonstrated through our annual reports. These reports give you a detailed look at how funds are allocated. The next one, covering the 2024/25 cycle, is set to be published in August. The team remains committed. Every engineer, designer, and contributor who shipped PoS remains with the project, looking to support what comes next. But even with the right people and a clear commitment, we recognize Nimiq needs more. Breaking the Echo Chamber To challenge our perspective, we brought in two experienced advisors: Serotonin, the marketing team behind Ethereum’s launch, helped us map out where crypto payments are, and where they’re heading. Jung von Matt, one of Europe’s top creative agencies, tested our messaging with real users and merchants to uncover how Nimiq is seen from the outside. Our combined research confirmed what we were starting to suspect: For day-to-day payments, stablecoins are being used instead of volatile assets due to their ability to reduce complexity and risk. Stablecoins have achieved the highest level of crypto payment product market fit. Crypto users live in multi‑chain worlds. Utility must cross ecosystems, not stay fenced inside one chain. Mobile first. If it isn’t effortless on a phone, it isn’t used. So, What Are We Doing About It? Organizationally We realized that our flat hierarchy, while great for fostering collaboration and agency, was making it harder to act quickly and efficiently. So, we brought in professional help. We partnered with OrgVolution, specialists in organizational development, and went through a series of assisted workshops. We set out to restructure our organization with four key goals in mind: Product ownership and accountability. Smarter, faster decision-making. KPIs that encourage everyone to stay sharp and adapt quickly. A culture of action over perfection. This isn’t just cosmetic. It’s a fundamental shift in how we look to approach the future. Strategically We refined our purpose and core principles. Now we’re focused on shaping what comes next for Nimiq. Our top priority is to ensure that whatever we do serves the health of the Nimiq ecosystem and the NIM token. At the same time, we’re actively looking beyond the domain we’ve traditionally focused on. This means exploring innovative fields such as AI, Real-World Assets (RWA), DeFi, and Interoperability. What to expect Clarity. Confidence. A Re-imagined Strategy. As soon as possible, we will reveal our new roadmap, along with a refreshed website and path forward. This strategic shift has been our main focus, but it has gone hand-in-hand with ongoing development. Several new features are getting ready to launch soon, including support for multisig transactions, a revamped developer center, tools for user feedback, a new private-key backup option for the Nimiq Wallet, and an improved staking user interface. Our commitment to NIM Though our reflections challenge the status quo and broaden the scope of opportunities, there is one thing the project never questioned: NIM is at the heart of Nimiq’s future.  We are 100% committed to the Nimiq Community. We deeply appreciate your support and participation and thank you for being on this journey with us. Your perspective matters! What do you think? Join the conversation and share your thoughts with us in the Nimiq Forum.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nimiq Ecosystem is maturing and a lot of progress has been made. The team is hard at work on both Nimiq 2.0 and Nimiq Checkout. We understand it can be difficult to keep up with developments and achievements since they’re spread out over the forum, on Telegram, Discordas well as GitHub. To help community members get a quick update on the high-level progress of the project, we want to share this progress report on a regular basis. If you are not familiar with the members of Team Nimiq, here is a quick summary of the team structure (leaving out legal and operations): Core (Blockchain Development & Research): Janosch, Jeff, Marvin, Pascal, Philipp, Richard. Frontend (UI/UX, Website, Apps): Daniel, Julian, Matheo, Tammo, Sebastian, Sören, Sven. Communication (Marketing, Content Creation, Social Media): Atua, Chris, Julian, Richy, Sven, Sui-Ju, Tammo.  Upcoming Goals Core Team Test and release of the Rust Nimiq Client Release Albatross Demonet including a demo and useful visualization First tests of Nimiq OASIS with TEN31 Bank Implementation of UTXOTree for Nimiq 2.0 Developing first use case of Nimiq OASIS Front-end Team Multicurrency Nimiq Checkout update (now accepting BTC and ETH in addition to NIM) Final tests and release of WordPress Plugin integrated with updated Nimiq Checkout (so you can accept BTC, ETH and NIM in WooCommerce without a payment provider!) Nimiq Donation button creator (easily add a button to your website to receive donations in NIM) Preparing concept and design of NimiqID to be shared with community Communications Team The Communications Team has designed a marketing strategy for the following year which resulted in the creation, discussion and approval of a marketing budget. Communications Team is also working on adding a new team member who will join us to take the role of Sales Engineer/Brand Ambassador. Concept and initial work of Nimiq OASIS communication strategy. Tutorials and documentation of Nimiq Checkout WordPress WooCommerce Plugin. Nimiq Community Rewards Program. Aligned with Front-end and Core to provide the community with video, tutorial and coding ideas that are easy to complete and will strengthen the Nimiq ecosystem. Community members who work on a project and complete the success criteria will be eligible for a nice reward in NIM.  Recent Achievements Nimiq 2.0 Whitepaper After a considerable amount of research and discussion, the Core Team gave us a first glimpse of where Nimiq 2.0 is going. Pascal (our Blockchain Engineer who recently received an award for his PhD Thesis, congrats!) wrote the first draft of the Nimiq 2.0 Whitepaper. With this initial text, Sven (Technical Writer) and Richy (Community Manager) adjusted the tonality and used the beautiful designs from Overnice (Julian, lead designer) to create the Nimiq 2.0 Whitepaper Update.   To switch between versions of the Whitepaper, you will now find a version selector on the Whitepaper website. We think this will also come in handy in future updates. Introducing UTXOTree  The UTXOTree is a novel data structure which will hold the balances of accounts in Nimiq 2.0. Currently, the Nimiq 1.0 Blockchain utilizes Merkle Trees as Ethereum does. For Nimiq 2.0 the Core Team has come up with a way of mixing the UTXO structure used by Bitcoin with the Merkle Trees. If it sounds groundbreaking it’s because it is! Faster consensus of Browser Clients with QuickSync  The Core Team recently added a new consensus mechanism to Browser Clients called Pico Consensus. Pico Consensus allows a Browser Client to reach consensus in seconds by downloading a small fraction of information of the Blockchain from peers of the network. If this is not successful for some reason then it would fallback to Nano Consensus, a mechanism with which the Browser client still reaches consensus in tens of seconds. This combination is what we call Nimiq QuickSync. Check it out in the Nimiq Safe! Nimiq Rust Node Release Candidate The Rust full-node has been improving since its first beta release last February. This is the result of the efforts of the Core Team over the last 6 months and our community members who tested the code and reported bugs. The Rust node is, in comparison to its JavaScript predecessor, highly performant and can be compiled to run natively on multiple platforms.   Now that Jeff (Blockchain Engineer, in charge of releases) has finished cleaning up the code and is fixing the last packaging issues, the Nimiq Rust Node is ready for its release candidate version. As always, it will undergo a review process and we would like to kick it off by asking for support from the community: if you are a Rust developer or you are running a Nimiq Node and you want to support us by testing it in your setup, visit the repositoryand simply follow the instructions in the README. Nimiq Checkout's First Integration Partner The Front-End Team has been focusing on developing Nimiq Checkout. After a lot of testing with our soon-to-be-announced ecommerce partner, the integration is close to being complete. This partner will use the Nimiq Checkout to accept BTC, ETH, and NIM as an additional payment option in their online store. We are excited for the first release of Nimiq Checkout and are gearing up to onboard more merchants in time. Release of TEN31 Website and their partnership with Salamantex Nimiq is part-owner of the German Financial institution WEG Bank AG, which recently announced its new crypto-focused venture TEN31 Bank. The new website of TEN31 Bank has been released and it prominently shows the close relationship of the Nimiq Ecosystem and the TEN31 Bank’s future endeavors.  Furthermore, the recent partnership of WEG Bank AG with the major Point-of-Sale provider Salamantex is noteworthy. Nothing official has been released yet, but the possibilities are indeed exciting. New Developer joins the Team We would like to publicly announce our newest addition to the Team: Matheo, a French Full Stack developer with experience in JavaScript and Vue. Matheo was actually introduced to the Team by an active community member, which makes Matheo the third member that joins the Team from the Nimiq community. He will be working on building new features and making UI improvements in the Nimiq Ecosystem. Let’s all say Hi to Matheo in the Nimiq forum and make him feel welcome.  Nimiq Explanatory Video A Video that quickly and clearly explains the main vision and captures the spirit of Nimiq has been overdue. We aimed to create an informative yet engaging video that community members could share with their friends and say: “See, this is what I’ve been trying to explain to you, a node in a browser!”.  We are happy with the result and started working on the next video. Want to share your opinion on the video, suggest an idea or request a video of a specific topic? Join the forum and create a topic. :) Thanks for reading. We hope this quick blog post helps you get an overview over the progress of the project.  Pura Vida! Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Pre-Staking Campaign was a resounding success, and it’s all thanks to you, the amazing Nimiq community! Your participation and enthusiasm have played a vital role in this migration milestone achievement. As anticipated, we are getting ready to distribute all campaign rewards.  Below, you’ll find detailed information about the giveaways and rewards distribution process—let’s dive in! Giveaways Selection The Prizes: 10 winners of 3 million NIM 25 winners of 1.5 million NIM 65 winners of 500k NIM To ensure a fair and transparent selection process, we’ve developed a script that uses the Nimiq Blockchain as a source of randomness. This script, which can be accessed and verified on GitHub, leverages block hashes to generate random seeds for selecting winners. How It Works: The script reads data from two sources: the Pre-Staking participant list and the prize pool. It will then utilize the election macro block hash from each day of the selection rounds (details provided below) as a randomness generator to pick a random participant as the winner for each prize. Once a participant wins, they are removed from the pool to ensure no duplicates. The process repeats for each prize, with new block hashes providing fresh randomness for every round. This approach ensures transparency and fairness, as anyone can verify the selection process by reviewing the block hashes and the script logic. Selection Rounds Winners will be chosen in three rounds: February 3rd: 3 winners of 3M NIM, 8 winners of 1.5M NIM, and 21 winners of 500k NIM February 10th: 3 winners of 3M NIM, 8 winners of 1.5M NIM, and 22 winners of 500k NIM February 17th: 4 winners of 3M NIM, 9 winners of 1.5M NIM, and 22 winners of 500k NIM Prizes will be delivered within one week of each round’s winner selection. To find out if you’ve won, visit: https://migration.nimiq.network/rewards and stay tuned to our social media channels for announcements. Pre-Staking Rewards In addition to the giveaways, the project allocated 100 million NIM as rewards for the Pre-Staking Campaign to be distributed evenly and proportionally to all participants who pre-staked their NIM. Based on the total amount pre-staked, the absolute reward rate comes to approximately 3% (~12% annualized!). This means participants receive ~0.030487 NIM per 1 pre-staked—an excellent reward for supporting the campaign! Winning participants who adhered to the campaign’s Terms of Service can expect to receive these rewards by or before the end of February. Validator Registration Rewards  Community members who registered a validator during the validator registration phase and comply with all the rules outlined in the official announcement, can also expect to receive their reward by or before the end of February. As stated in the terms, rewards will be deposited to the validator's address. Winners Are Coming The first winners will be announced on February 3rd. Stay tuned and see if the gods of Proof of Stake smile upon you! To see if you’ve won, visit: https://migration.nimiq.network/rewards or follow our social media channels for updates. Good luck, and thank you for being an integral part of the Nimiq journey!]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[As we reflect on the journey we've shared, we also offer a glimpse into what's next for Nimiq as we step into 2025.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq has achieved a monumental milestone with the release of the eagerly anticipated upgrade to Proof of Stake. This key development has transformed Nimiq into a robust and efficient payment ecosystem with innovative features such as staking, minimal energy consumption, rapid payment transactions, and a performance level primed for global scale processing. With this final piece of the puzzle, the complete picture of a Payment Ecosystem is now fully outlined. The journey to this point has been exhilarating and challenging, made possible by the unwavering support of everyone in the Nimiq community. As we stand at the threshold of 2025, we proudly recognize Nimiq as not only a ready-for-mass-adoption payment ecosystem but also as one of the most enduring payment projects within the cryptocurrency space. The Nimiq Payment Ecosystem The Nimiq ecosystem now features a robust collection of tools designed to enable everyone to have non-custodial access for holding, sending, and receiving money through crypto payments. As these tools evolve, the ecosystem will become even more accessible, empowering non-tech-savvy users to easily start making payments with crypto. At the core is our non-custodial wallet, enabling every user to directly participate in and contribute to the network, bolstering security and decentralization. It also supports non-custodial swaps, allowing seamless transactions between NIM, BTC, and USDC/USDT on Polygon. Complementing the wallet, our web-based Point of Sale system, accessible at cplink.com, facilitates easy and secure transactions for both merchants and consumers. The Nimiq Pay mobile app extends these capabilities, taking advantage of mobile native technology such as NFC and allowing users to effortlessly make payments in hundreds of thousands of stores globally by integrating different payment networks like Bitcoin Lightning. This is complemented by our crypto map, which not only lists all the places where you can pay with crypto but also makes it easy for users to find these locations. These interconnected components are meticulously designed to support rapid, cost-effective, and eco-friendly transactions, paving the way for global adoption and broadening the utility of the NIM token.

In summary, the Team Nimiq took a first-principles thinking approach to thoroughly understand and address the fundamental needs of individuals in the realm of payments. Then developed an extensive suite of tools and services aimed at enabling true peer-to-peer non-custodial payments, thereby fulfilling Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision.  By tackling every facet of the payment process—from desktop and mobile transactions to merchant acceptance, store of value solutions, stablecoins, and high-performance payment coins—Nimiq ensures a fully decentralized and user-centric experience. This comprehensive strategy not only empowers users with complete control over their funds but also enhances accessibility and drives widespread adoption.

            <description><![CDATA[ This blog post provides a technical summary of the Ceremony, aimed at both the Nimiq Community and other crypto project]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nimiq Network is steadily progressing toward its migration to Proof-of-Stake. Although the migration will officially occur at a specific block height, the groundwork began months ago. If you're curious about the different phases, they’re detailed here. One of the more time-consuming phases was the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Ceremony, which started many months ago and concluded recently.

For those new to ZKPs, you can explore Part 1 and Part 2 of our blog series on Zero-Knowledge Proofs for more details. In brief, ZKPs in the Nimiq ecosystem enable browser clients to verify their balance on the blockchain by downloading small-sized proofs instead of the entire blockchain history. Prover nodes in the Nimiq Network generate these proofs using specific proving keys, while other nodes use corresponding verifying keys to validate them.
 The ZKP Ceremony is a decentralized, trustless process that generates the initial proving and verifying keys. It’s a multi-party computation (MPC) effort, where multiple participants run guided computations to create the keys, thereby minimizing trust assumptions and preventing the creation of false proofs.
 The Nimiq ZKP Ceremony took place from December 2023 to August 2024, involving 168 participants across two phases. The results from Phase 1 can be used by other crypto projects for similar ceremonies. This post will detail the process and offer suggestions for anyone planning their own ZKP Ceremony.  To learn more about both phases of the ZKP Ceremony, check out our blog posts on Phase 1 and Phase 2.  Summary Here’s a general summary of the entire process:  Process Overview: The ceremony was conducted in two phases, each with different goals. Contributors from around the world worked together to ensure the security of the generated keys. Support and Instructions: We provided comprehensive instructions on our Nimiq Forum and support during the entire process via our Discord server, where Nimiq team members were available to support the contributors. Phases: Each phase had specific goals. Phase 1 focused on generating a dataset that participants could use for their own projects, allowing them to run only Phase 2 if needed. Phase 2 targeted generating the specific keys for our circuits.  Results  As explained above, there are two independent phases, each with its own set of results.  Phase 1 is for generating generic parameters for the ZKP circuits, called the Powers of Tau. These parameters are only specific to the cryptographic curve and ZKP proving system being used. They can be reused by other projects, thus this first phrase is the one that is relevant to the entire crypto space. Phase 2 then builds upon Phase 1, refining the parameters of the ZKP circuits and ultimately generating both proving and verifying keys for the Nimiq-specific use case. These keys need to be derived for each statement that is to be proven in zero-knowledge proofs.  Phase 1: Powers of Tau The output of this phase can be used for either Groth16 circuits up to the size of the phase or universal proving systems such as PLONK and Marlin. As mentioned before, the results from this phase can be used by other crypto projects intending to perform similar ceremonies. Those interested are welcome to contact us via Telegram, Discord or X.
 Here are the details of Phase 1 of the Nimiq ZKP Ceremony: Participants: 92 Rounds: 9 (20 participants each) Timeline: January 23 - April 24  Phase 2: Nimiq’s Circuits The participants contributed to refining the parameters of the Nimiq ZKP circuits and ultimately generated the proving and verifying keys.  Here are the details of Phase 2 of the Nimiq ZKP Ceremony: Participants: 76 Rounds: 4 (20 participants each) Timeline: May 25 - July 26  Attestations Attestations are proofs that prove that a participant actually contributed to a specific phase. These proofs use beacon hashes from the Bitcoin blockchain, which are stored in the attestation repository. You can manually verify the commit dates by accessing the attestation repository here.
 The keys generated in the ceremony are the final result of the entire process and can be accessed as follows: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) IPFS is a decentralized file storage system that allows users to share and access files in a peer-to-peer network. The IPFS CID for the folder containing the keys is <code>QmUuSz4EFc9EAvRzz8FVAah7xh2huWtiU5vDgzkfR1gXMY</code>. If you don't have access to an IPFS node you can use a gateway to access the files via your browser (or other HTTP clients), such as:  Via Public Gateways: For example, using ipfs.io or dweb.link (this could be slow as these gateways may need to retrieve the files first if they don't have them on their local storage). Via Our Own Gateway: Nimiq IPFS Gateway (which already has the files pinned to its local storage).  BitTorrent You have two options to download via BitTorrent: BitTorrent File: Torrent File Using a Magnet Link: simply copy and paste <a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:2cc3ca7888b75f1c38f2c4013f6eb3631946e2e9&dn=nimiq-zkp-keys&tr=https%3A%2F%2Ftorrents.nimiq.io%2Fannounce">this link</a> into your BitTorrent client. The magnet link is a URL that contains all the information needed for the client to download the files. After pasting the link, your client will connect to peers sharing the file and start the download process.  Suggestions for Running a ZKP Ceremony  For those interested in running a ZKP Ceremony, we are happy to share our experience and the results from Phase 1. Some general suggestions for the entire process:
 Make a Test Run: Conduct a test run with your team to identify and address potential issues before the actual ceremony. This will help you spot any problems early and be prepared to resolve them, ensuring a smoother process. Community Engagement: Set up clear communication channels where participants can easily access information and FAQs. Have one or two team members available to answer any questions that come up. Active support will help keep everyone on track and informed.
Technical Requirements: Specify the technical requirements for participants, including hardware, software, and network needs. Make sure this information is readily available and easy to understand. Contributors' Responsibilities: Ensure volunteers know their roles and tasks during the ceremony well. Outline what is expected, specify the tasks, and the importance of following the guidelines. Make sure the volunteers understand the expected time and effort.
Participant Readiness: Let participants know that coordination is key—having everyone prepared for their round at the same time helps things flow more smoothly. Provide clear instructions, comprehensive documentation, and troubleshooting tips to ensure everyone is ready.
Clear Information and Guidelines: Make sure all important information is clearly stated. Emphasize the need for participants to securely delete any sensitive data related to key generation. Providing detailed guidelines for every step of the process will help maintain security and clarity.
Plan for Unforeseen Scenarios: Be prepared for unexpected issues. Small delays or extending the duration of rounds may be necessary to ensure a successful ceremony. Flexibility can help manage these situations effectively.  Verification of the Results Each round was thoroughly verified before proceeding to the next. If you would like to verify the results or have any questions about this process, please feel free to contact us via our Telegram or Discord groups.

 Using the Results in Nimiq Proof-of-Stake 
 Thanks to the zero-knowledge proofs, light, browser, and full nodes can sync swiftly to the network. Prover nodes generate these proofs with a proving key –which each prover node downloads to their system– and light nodes then verify the chain's correctness using the corresponding verifying key.  The ceremony is the initial part, where contributors generate the proving and verifying keys. Prover nodes then utilize these keys to generate the ZKPs, more specifically, recursive zk-SNARKS. Instead of growing the proving time linearly with the chain, we use the proof of the previous election block to generate the proof for the current one. This way, we can recursively prove specific points within the blockchain.  What's Next?  We are grateful to everyone who participated in the ZKP Ceremony and are thrilled to announce that Nimiq transition to PoS is now getting  very close to happening. We are excited to share the results with our community and are open to discuss the results and process with anyone interested.  Thank you for your continued support and involvement. The journey to Nimiq PoS continues, and we look forward to the next steps!

            <description><![CDATA[The migration process to Nimiq PoS follows several phases. We are thrilled to announce the start of the first of three p]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[NOTE: In the interest of delivering the migration within the time frame presented, the phases and their deadlines are of CRITICAL importance, so please work well within them! The day has come. As Nimiq PoS quickly approaches Release Candidate status, we can now announce the dates for Nimiq PoS migration. The selected block height for the start of the Activation Phase is block 3456000, approximately translating to 7 AM UTC, November 19, 2024. Keep in mind that the exact time will shift slightly due to the nature of Proof-of-Work blockchains. Things are getting real, and now more than ever, it is important for the Nimiq Community to stay informed and understand how to participate in the upcoming migration phases. Here are the approximate dates for the three phases, kicking off with the first, the “Validator Registration” Phase, which lasts no more than 23 days, followed by the second, the “Pre-Staking Phase” which lasts no more than 34 days, and culminating in the third, the “Activation Phase”: Phase 1: Validator Registration 
Starts: September 12
Ends: October 6 Phase 2: Pre-Staking
Starts: October 7
Ends: November 10 Phase 3: Activation
Starts: November 19, ~7 AM UTC
Ends: When 80% of the pre-staked NIM signals readiness. After 24 hours from the start, the activation resets for a new candidate transition block and activation attempt.   Participate in the Validator Registration Phase Many of our community members interested in participating have already been involved in testing, or are currently running a validator or validator pool in the PoS testnet. For those looking to learn more, we recently hosted a Twitter Space with community-managed pools, which you can find here. For those already running a validator, the documentation for participating in the Registration phase can be found here. If you have questions, feel free to join the discussion in the Nimiq Forum, Telegram, or Discord, where community developers and Team Nimiq members are happy to help. We encourage the community to spread the word and invite any tech-savvy friends who might be interested in running a validator. To incentivize the availability of a variety of Validator Pools, Community Developers running a Validator Pool will receive extra rewards. Please keep in mind that only validators who registered during the Validator Registration Phase will be eligible for the migration. By participating as Validator in the migration you are making history and will earn the very first staking rewards issued by the protocol. Others will have to wait until after the migration to join the network. The Validator Registration Phase is the opening of this transition. In this phase, we will establish the very first validator list for the Nimiq PoS chain. This is your chance to be one of the first validators. We invite everyone interested to register between Thursday, September 12, and Sunday, October 6. All you need to do is follow the instructions provided here. After October 6, no more validator registrations will be accepted and can result in a loss of funds! Plans for the Pre-Staking Phase The Pre-Staking Phase is crucial for the migration’s success. The more NIM staked, the healthier the PoS network will be when the migration occurs. We are planning an incentive campaign to reward early supporters who participate in Pre-Staking. More information will be provided in the coming weeks. Until Pre-Staking, we urge the community to focus on validator registration and ensure that as many validators as possible are registered before the deadline of October 6th. Activation Phase The Activation Phase marks the last of the three-phase transition process and is the one that finalizes the migration. On Tuesday November 19, the community will have the first opportunity to migrate the existing PoW chain to the new PoS protocol. The final decision rests with the registered validators of the Nimiq PoS network. The migration will take place as soon as 80% of the total stake gathered during the Registration and Pre-Staking phases signals readiness.  The design process for the Activation Phase has been updated slightly since the previous blog post. The improvements ensure a smoother and more efficient transition to PoS. We will share a detailed blog post closer to the Activation Phase to explain these adjustments, guide you through the process, and update the previous blog post for consistency. Frequently Asked Questions As we prepare for the transition to Proof-of-Stake, we have put together answers to some questions to help guide you through this process: Does every Nimiq user need to run the migration tools to transition to PoS? No, the migration is only required for those who want to benefit from and make history by being among the first validators or operating nodes at the start of PoS. Regular users don't need to take any action. I own a Nimiq Wallet and hold NIM. Do I need to participate in the migration? While all NIM holders are encouraged to participate in the migration and pre-stake to support the network, participation is not mandatory. If you choose not to participate, your wallet and transaction history will remain unaffected and automatically be transferred after the Activation Phase. Can I log into my Nimiq Wallet with the same Login File after the transition? Yes, your local private keys remain untouched by this process, and you can log in with the same Login File and credentials after the transition. Do I need to be a miner to register as a validator? No, anyone can register as a validator, regardless of whether they are a miner or not. What happens if the activation doesn’t collect 80% of readiness in the first activation window? A new activation window will open every 24 hours if 80% readiness is not reached during an activation window. This process will repeat until the readiness threshold is achieved. What happens if I don’t join the Pre-Staking Phase? If you miss pre-staking to a validator, you can still participate once the PoS chain is live and delegate stake to a validator. For more detailed answers and additional questions about the migration, please visit our Migration FAQ. The Migration Process to Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Begins This Week The migration process follows a specific sequence of phases, starting with Validator Registration this week and followed by the Pre-Staking Phase. The Activation Phase only takes place once both preceding phases are complete. To ensure a smooth transition and allow ample time for everyone in the community to participate, we have organized timeframes that are carefully planned backwards from the activation date of November 19. Based on this schedule, the migration process starts this week with the Validator Registration phase. We can’t emphasize enough how important it is to get a diverse amount of quality validators registered over the next month. Time is limited, and the stakes – pun intended – have never been higher. We want to end this blog post by thanking all the community developers and contributors who have been part of this journey. As the time approaches, we will release more blog posts covering the Pre-Staking and Activation phases, so stay tuned! Pura Vida,

            <description><![CDATA[In this post, we’ll cover why Nimiq is making this upgrade, what it means for the network, and what it means for you as ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Overview Nimiq is about to undergo a big upgrade! It is migrating from a Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, and this blog post will walk you through what that means, in simple terms.

If you hold NIM (Nimiq’s native cryptocurrency), you’re probably wondering how this affects you.

Let’s dive in! First, What Do NIM Holders Have To Do? The good news? You don’t need to take any action—NIM will continue to function seamlessly, but with enhanced speed, efficiency, and lower costs thanks to the migration—no complex steps or technical know-how needed. Same wallet. Same address. There is no new coin being introduced.  It all happens automatically. But here’s the exciting part: You can receive amazing rewards and have the chance to win prizes by choosing to stake early! There’s an exclusive pre-staking campaign which will allow you to actively participate in the migration, support the network, and receive rewards—all while growing your holdings—essentially free NIM just for staking what you already hold. It’s a simple and easy way to grow your holdings while supporting the future of Nimiq. Why miss out on this opportunity?

For a more technical overview of the Nimiq migration click here! What Does the Switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake Mean? You’ve likely heard terms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) before, but what do they actually mean? Let’s break it down: Proof of Work (PoW) Nimiq started as a Proof of Work blockchain. Such blockchain operates by having digital “miners” solve complex puzzles using powerful computers to validate transactions, ensuring their authenticity and securing the network. However, this process requires a significant amount of electricity, and as more miners compete to solve these puzzles, energy consumption increases. While Bitcoin has proven to be a very secure system, transaction processing is relatively slow, and the network can lead to very high electricity demand and costs. Proof of Stake (PoS) Proof of Stake is a more modern and efficient system. Instead of relying on miners, PoS allows “validators” that put up or pool a certain amount of the network token as “stake” to validate transactions. The higher the amount of NIM a validator represents with the stake, the higher is his relative contribution to securing the network. PoS is faster, uses far less energy, and allows Nimiq to scale up much more easily.

Plain language: Think of Proof of Stake as a system where participants "prove" they have a stake in the network by holding NIM.

This “skin in the game” incentivizes honesty and efficiency, making it a win-win for everyone involved. What are the Benefits of Proof of Stake? Better Performance Currently, with Proof of Work, Nimiq can handle a maximum average of 10 transactions per second. This number is not sufficient for supporting large-scale usage and is a well-known limitation of Bitcoin. With Nimiq's new Proof of Stake approach, this capacity will skyrocket to 1'000+ transactions per second! This means more users can transact simultaneously without slowing down the network and without increasing network fees per transaction under heavy usage. This opens the doors for mass adoption of Nimiq in true peer-to-peer on-chain format. Better Energy Efficiency Proof of Work relies on a process called "mining," which consumes a lot of energy. In contrast, Proof of Stake eliminates the need for such high energy-consuming computations, making Nimiq much more environmentally friendly. Faster Transactions Right now under Proof of Work, transactions can take over a minute to be received, which might not seem like much. But if you're paying for something quick, like a coffee, that wait can be frustrating. With Proof of Stake, transactions will be confirmed in just a few seconds, making everyday payments faster and smoother for everyone. Staking NIM One of the most exciting changes with this migration is the ability to easily stake your NIM. Staking is the process of locking up your NIM to help secure the network, and in return, you get staking rewards. This creates a great incentive to acquire and hold NIM, as holders can receive passive rewards simply by participating in the staking process. In short: Nimiq’s transition to Proof of Stake will make the network faster, more environmentally friendly, and let every user stake NIM to receive NIM rewards—creating a better overall experience for users, all the while not compromising decentralization. Staking Explained: How You Can Receive NIM Rewards Staking is one of the most exciting features that Nimiq’s transition to Proof of Stake brings. Building on what we discussed earlier, staking allows you to “lock up” your NIM to help secure the network. In return for contributing to the network’s security, you receive rewards in the form of additional NIM issued by the protocol itself. How Does Staking Work? When you stake your NIM, you’re locking your coins on the network for a certain period of time. These staked coins help a validator verify transactions and keep the blockchain secure. The more NIM you stake, the more rewards you can potentially receive—making it an easy way to grow your holdings while supporting the network. To make things easier, Nimiq created a staking calculator that can help you estimate how much you could get by staking your NIM. Click here to check out the Nimiq Staking Calculator! Simply enter the amount of NIM you plan to stake and see the potential rewards. Who’s Involved in the Migration; Who Does What? Different groups will play specific roles during the migration: NIM Holders As we’ve mentioned, while you don’t need to take action to keep using your NIM, NIM holders play a crucial role in the migration by pre-staking their NIM. By pre-staking, you lock up your NIM with a Validator until the migration is complete, helping secure the migration process. In return, you receive pre-staking rewards, along with the chance to win an additional bonus giveaway. Validators Validators are responsible for creating blocks and validating transactions. To become a validator, you need to hold a significant amount of NIM and run software that processes transactions and validates blocks. Validators play a key role in maintaining the network’s security and efficiency. Validator Staking Pools Becoming a Validator requires technical expertise and having a machine running 24/7. That’s where validators that operate staking pools come in. NIM holders can delegate their coins to a staking pool, and the pool handles all the technical work in exchange for a reward fee. This makes it easy for anyone, even without technical skills, to participate in the staking process and receive rewards. How Will the Migration Take Place? Phases of the Migration The migration will occur in three key phases: Validator Registration Phase (Currently underway)
Begins: September 12
Ends: October 6
During this phase, users interested in becoming validators can register. This is essential for setting up the network’s security infrastructure under the new PoS system. Pre-staking Phase
Begins: October 7
Ends: November 10
In this phase, users can begin staking their NIM before the full migration is complete. This allows users to start receiving rewards early by locking their NIM in staking contracts. Activation Phase
Begins: November 19, ~7 AM UTC
Ends: When 80% of the pre-staked NIM is ready.

This phase triggers the full activation of the Proof of Stake system. Validators will start operating, and NIM holders will begin enjoying the new system’s benefits. Final Thoughts Nimiq’s transition to Proof of Stake marks a huge leap forward, making the network faster, more eco-friendly, and ready for mass adoption. This is the upgrade we’ve all been waiting for—designed to ensure Nimiq is primed for the future. As a NIM holder, the best part is that you don’t need to do anything—your NIM will seamlessly migrate to the new system, no button-pushing required. But, pre-staking offers an exciting opportunity to receive rewards and actively support the network’s growth. Stay tuned for more updates as the migration progresses, and feel free to reach out with any questions. This is just the beginning of a brighter, faster, and more efficient Nimiq!

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq's Pre-staking campaign with 200 million NIM in rewards is live! Don’t miss your chance to join and support the mig]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We're excited to announce that the Nimiq Pre-staking Rewards and Giveaway Campaign is live and will run from Monday October 7 to Sunday November 10! The campaign is aimed at supporting a smooth migration to Nimiq's new Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which is planned to begin November 19 (learn more about the migration process). This campaign rewards everyone that supports the migration by pre-staking their NIM (rules apply). There are 200 million NIM in rewards up for grabs! Why Participate in Pre-Staking? Pre-staking is an essential step for the successful transition to Nimiq PoS. A secure migration depends on maximizing the total amount of NIM pre-staked and distributing it across as many validators as possible. This campaign is designed to incentivize all Nimiq Holders to pre-stake and contribute to a more decentralized Nimiq network. IMPORTANT: All pre-staked NIM will be locked until the migration is complete. The Nimiq core team has worked diligently to harden and improve the security and performance of the Nimiq PoS codebase. This new implementation has also been peer-reviewed by Nimiq community developers. Earlier this year, Nimiq organized code audits and a public bug bounty program in collaboration with the renowned security audit company HackerOne (listen to the Twitter Space here). The migration process itself has undergone multiple rounds of testing together with community developers. Team Nimiq has done everything possible to ensure the success of the migration, transitioning from PoW to PoS is an inherently complex process. This campaign is a token of appreciation to all Nimiq community members who support the pre-staking process, trusting in the careful preparation carried out by both the Nimiq developers and the community. Who Can Participate? Anyone holding or acquiring NIM can join in on the campaign—except for residents from countries on the OFAC sanctions list and the USA. Campaign Duration Start: Monday October 7, 2024 (~00:01 UTC) End: Sunday November 10, 2024 (~23:59 UTC) The rewards and bonuses will be distributed up to 90 days after the migration takes place. Stay tuned to our official social channels to stay updated and find out if you're one of the lucky winners.  Check out the FAQ if you have any questions. Be cautious of impersonators and trust only these channels: Nimiq’s Blog, X (formerly Twitter), Discord, and Telegram. What’s Up for Grabs? 200 Million NIM! The earlier you participate, the more rewards you can potentially get. Plus, it's a key way to help secure the network. Pre-staking isn’t just for hardcore users—it’s an easy and rewarding way for every NIM holder to get involved without a long-term commitment.  A total of 200 million NIM (!) are allocated in the Pre-staking Campaign: 100 million NIM as Pre-staking Rewards: based on your stake in proportion to the total amount of NIM pre-staked. 100 million NIM in additional Bonus Giveaways: your chances increase as you accumulate points for staking a certain way (timing, choice of pool, etc): 10 giveaways of 3 million NIM 25 giveaways of 1 million NIM 65 giveaways of 500’000 NIM Get Multipliers for Higher Chances to get a Bonus: Boost your chances of receiving bonus giveaways by earning multipliers: Pre-stake early: The earlier you pre-stake, the higher your time-based multiplier. Choose an underdog validator: Select a validator with less than 10% of the total pre-stake for an additional multiplier. Join the Nimiq Galxe quests: Earn more multipliers based on your ranking in Nimiq's Galxe Space. The more you optimize your pre-staking strategy, the better your chances!

Learn more details on the Pre-staking page! 
How to Participate? From Monday October 7 to Sunday November 10, 2024, follow these simple steps to join the pre-staking campaign: 1. Go to wallet.nimiq.com   After logging into your account, you will find important information about the campaign.  2. Find the Pre-Stake Button  Look for the button with a golden plant-like icon to begin the pre-staking process.  3. Select a Validator   Choose a validator from the list. Picking a validator with a lower amount of staked funds helps decentralize the network and grants you a bonus multiplier in the Pre-staking Giveaway.  4. Enter Your Amount  Decide how much NIM you want to pre-stake. And confirm stake.  5. Claim your points   To become eligible for and associate your staking address with the Rewards and Bonus Giveaway Campaign, simply log in to prestaking.nimiq.network/pre-staking using the same account address you used for pre-staking. The registered address will also be used to distribute any rewards. You can register multiple addresses. Click here to learn about multipliers and see all the rules for the giveaway. Time to Spread the Word! The moment has come for the Nimiq Community to unite and propel this campaign forward! Share it with your crypto friends and help spread the news throughout the crypto space. Let’s show everyone that Nimiq is migrating to Proof of Stake and that now is the perfect time to get involved! Stay tuned through our official channels, be cautious of impersonators, and gear up for Proof of Stake!

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq is gearing up to upgrade its network to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), making payment processing faster and more energy-eff]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq launched in 2018 with a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm that utilized NiPoPoWs, enabling browsers to act as peers in the blockchain network—a major leap forward in decentralized payments. But that was just the beginning. Following the successful launch of the Nimiq PoW Blockchain, the Nimiq team, together with its community began working on the future transition to Proof-of-Stake. The Nimiq community has been testing the PoS Testnet for over 19 months since its original release. The PoS Testnet has undergone a private code audit by HackerOne and currently has an active Public Bug Bounty Program running. You can find the full migration plan, detailing the various phases, in this blog post. After completing a successful validator registration phase, Nimiq is now in the Pre-Staking phase. Once Pre-Staking concludes, the final phase of the migration—called the activation phase—is expected to begin on November 19 2024, when block #3 456 000 on the PoW mainnet chain is mined. The Testnet has also been used to simulate the activation process with the help of community developers. After extensive testing, security improvements, and optimizations, the Testnet has now met the necessary criteria to be considered a Release Candidate by the Nimiq Core Team. This milestone follows the recent publication of the ZKP Ceremony Results and aligns with the migration process outlined in our previous blog post. For those eager to dive in, you can find the release candidate code here. Keep reading if you’d like more details on this release, validator registration, the Pre-Staking campaign, and key migration dates. Release Candidate Criteria Nimiq's core team has determined that, among other security and performance criteria, the Testnet must undergo continuous stress testing at maximum capacity, conducted in intervals of one week. While this scenario is unlikely under normal conditions, it provides a solid basis for analyzing the Nimiq PoS Blockchain Network under heavy load. A detailed technical discussion is beyond the scope of this blog post. Developers interested in more information about the Release Candidate are welcome to join our join our Telegram or Discord groups, where we have a dedicated channel for developers. Next Steps for the Release Candidate The Testnet will continue to undergo rigorous testing by the development team and the Nimiq community. This includes additional stress tests, vulnerability assessments, and performance evaluations. However, this announcement marks a shift from development and feature additions toward migration preparation and fine-tuning. What’s Next Our immediate priorities are further testing, promoting the Pre-Staking Campaign, and improving documentation. With 200 million NIM in rewards, the Pre-Staking campaign is an excellent opportunity for newcomers to get involved with Nimiq before the network officially migrates to Proof-of-Stake. To boost visibility, we are organizing X Spaces and YouTube videos featuring key figures in the crypto space. These efforts will highlight the Pre-Staking campaign, the upcoming migration to PoS, and the broader Nimiq project. Stay tuned to Nimiq's social media channels, and help us spread the word throughout the crypto community. Thank you for your continued support—Proof-of-Stake is just around the corner, and now is the time to let everyone know! Pura Vida,
Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[New report for the period following July 2023]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In line with the last report, we would like to present an updated overview of the assets and use of funds for the Nimiq project, as well as updated details of the distribution of NIM tokens and the circulating supply. The period covered since the last report is August 1, 2023 through July 31, 2024. The report indicates a slightly increased burn-rate in-line with expectations, as well as a modest increase in net assets due to favorable crypto market value developments and diversification. Assets and use of funds Assets The Nimiq Project continues to hold a variety of liquid and non-liquid assets. The 9.9% stake in German TEN31 (WEG) Bank AG was revalued based on continued divestments of the bank from the crypto sector. Similarly the real estate holdings were updated based on current market value estimates. As of publication of the report the Nimiq Project had the following assets: 119.8 BTC ~ US$ 7.16 Mio 1’002.3 ETH ~ US$ 2.61 Mio 398.0 Mio NIM (besides genesis NIM) ~ US$ 0.54 Mio EUR, USD & USDC ~ US$ 1.13 Mio Stake in TEN31 (WEG) Bank ~ US$ 2.20 Mio (reassessed) Real Estate ~ US$ 2.00 Mio (reassessed) Loan to ImpactX Foundation: ~ US$ 33.8K Reserves (see "Use of funds") ~ US$ (-0.36 Mio) Total Net Assets: ~US$ 15.31 Mio Use of funds The use of funds from the end of July 2023 up to the end of July 2024 breaks down as follows:  Product Development Contracting, Compensations: This includes all research, design, implementation and maintenance work regarding the Nimiq protocol on its way to switching from Proof-of-work to Proof-of-stake, the Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme (OASIS), Cryptopayment Link, Crypto Map, the iOS and Android Nimiq Pay Apps and other related apps and systems. The report indicates the expected, reasonable increase in contracting expenses due to inflation adjustments and team growth. An additional amount of ~US$ 260K continues to be reserved and due pending achievement of development goals (release of Proof of Stake for Nimiq, etc). ~US$ 1’952.8K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~57.4% of total (~64.0% of non-extraordinary) Marketing, Content, Community: This includes expenses related to creating and distributing educational video and written content, branding and sponsorships, swag production, user and consumer surveys, community project funding, rewards and campaigns, social media management and industry conference expenses. It also includes a phased out membership contribution to the Blockchain for Europe organization and supporting the European “Kryptostadt” and Latin American “Criptociudad” ( translate into “Cryptocity”) efforts that aid NIM adoption. In addition, this covers ongoing community programs such as the Bug Bounty Program and the Community Project Funding with a reserve of US$ 50K for the next 12 months. An amount of US$ 50K is reserved and due pending listing related pre-staking provisions. ~US$ 431.1K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~12.7% of total (~14.1% of non-extraordinary) Legal, Administration, Taxes: This includes legal, tax and administrative expenses regarding corporate maintenance, contract review, accounting, professional support from Lara Legal Corp, Annerton Rechtsanwälte, MHP trademark & design attorneys, and additional task specific international legal counsel i.e. for pursuing required licenses, trademarking, terms of services, privacy policies, legal memorandums, etc. The increased cost reflects the trademark efforts around protecting NIM, Nimiq and Cryptocity in various languages and jurisdictions, as well as the setup of an additional European operations entity as one of the many requirements for acquiring the necessary legal umbrella for operating OASIS in the EU zone. ~US$ 213.3K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~6.3% of total (~7.0% of non-extraordinary) Digital Operations, Equipment: This includes expenses related to hosting, hardware, software, licensing, communications, domains, and other development tools and platforms. The slight increase in this position is mainly due to increased hosting costs and equipment reimbursements for the growing team.  ~US$ 165.6K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~4.9% of total (~5.4% of non-extraordinary) Travel, F&B: This includes expenses related to transportation, hotel, food/beverage, and team building. The slight decrease in expenses here reflects a lowered cost base for hosting hackathons by adding a European location and optimizing the number of hackathons. ~US$ 140.8K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~4.1% of total (~4.6% of non-extraordinary) Physical Operations, Rent: This includes expenses related to workspace, operational security, hackathon accommodation, and maintenance. In line with the previous category expenses also decreased slightly. ~US$ 146.8K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~4.3% of total (~4.8% of non-extraordinary) Extraordinary: This includes fees and a bounty buffer for the HackerOne code audit and bug bounty program targeting Nimiq Proof-of-Stake. It also includes an upfront payment associated with the challenging acquisition of a legal umbrella for OASIS in the EU zone. Going forward we expect additional costs around solving this challenge as well as setup costs for the technology and infrastructure as a service for Nimiq OASIS. ~US$ 353.1K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~10.4% of total Total Use of Funds: ~US$ 3’403.5K (US$ 3’050.4K non-extraordinary)  The monthly burn-rate average comes in at ~US$ 255K (excluding extraordinary expenses). As predicted in last year's report the total expenses related to Product Development Contracting, Compensations have reasonably increased due to the hiring of additional highly qualified contributors, including core, frontend, business and ecosystem developers. With these new engagements, the long-standing team has reached a level of quality and capacity such that no significant further hires are anticipated in the short- to mid-term. Marketing, Community, Content expenses were more or less steady, which is mostly attributable to the holding pattern the project has been in prior to releasing the Proof-of-Stake upgrade and the pending release of OASIS in a first latin american location. The project continues to support the growth of open efforts such as the European “Kryptostadt”, Latin American “Criptociudad” and its recent addition of “Cryptocity” efforts in Gambia and Nigeria on the African continent. In addition efforts are underway to create awareness around the new native Nimiq Pay iOS and Android apps that now support paying with NIM wherever Bitcoin Lightning is accepted, an industry breakthrough by all standards. With increasing activities targeting the adoption of the “NIM <> BTC <> USD Stable Coin Trinity” in the payment acceptance and crypto holding process, we expect a corresponding rise in that expense category going forward. Expenses related to Legal, Administration, Taxes, and Physical Operations, Rent are overall holding steady. The relative increase in Digital Operations, Equipment is attributable to increased hosting costs and growing reimbursements for equipment. The relative reduction in Travel, F&B is attributable to the optimization of hackathon location and frequency. NIM supply and distribution This second part describes the distribution of NIM tokens, showing details of accounts and vesting contracts as well as the circulating and total supply as of the end of July. Quick view Live summary of NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply.txt The total final NIM supply over ~100 years by design of the Nimiq Blockchain Proof-of-Work protocol (see Nimiq Whitepaper 1.0): 21'000'000'000 NIM. The circulating supply as of the end of July was ~12’220’000’000 NIM (~58.2% of final total). Details NIM activated from Token Sale NET (5% of final total): As of the end of July 2024, 861’049’052 NIM have been activated from NET and are part of the circulating supply. The remaining difference (~188’950’948 NIM) that has not been activated from NET is visible at account addresses NQ69 9A4A MB83 HXDQ 4J46 BH5R 4JFF QMA9 C3GN, NQ15 MLJN 23YB 8FBM 61TN 7LYG 2212 LVBG 4V19 and NQ17 YTX4 X5U6 5BUX HN5J V6VV 260V 9UP1 D39S. Though the deadline for activating NIM has long passed, Nimiq is processing requests on a case by case, manual basis (applying the same conditions of KYC/AML). Being conservative, Nimiq considers them part of the circulating supply. All other NIM are either acquired through mining or released through a vesting contract as further described below (all vesting durations are measured from April 14 2018).  NIM minable (88% of final total): 18'480'000'000 NIM over ~100 years since April 2018. As of the end of July: ~10’060’000’000 NIM (~47.9% of final total) are part of the circulating supply. The live amount mined to date is available here: http://nim.sh/stats/supply/mined/nim.txt  Nimiq Foundation (Project, 2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ09 VF5Y 1PKV MRM4 5LE1 55KV P6R2 GXYJ XYQF. Vesting is 26'250'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 315’000’000 NIM (1.5% of final total) are available and part of the circulating supply. These funds have not been touched to date.
 ImpactX Foundation (Charity, 2% of final total): 420'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ19 YG54 46TX EHGQ D2R2 V8XA JX84 UFG0 S0MC. Vesting is 21'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 252’000’000 NIM (1.2% of final total) are available and part of the circulating supply. These funds have not been touched to date. In June 2021 a US$ 33’780 (1 BTC) donation was made to the charity: water’s bitcoin trust with an interest-rate-free loan from Nimiq to the ImpactX Foundation.  Nimiq Team & Early Contributors (2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at 82 vesting contract addresses, see https://pastebin.com/raw/1eDwDF45. Vesting schedule A (for creators) was 35'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 3 years and vesting schedule B was 157'500'000 NIM month 3 and month 6 (team, early contributors and future team member allocation).

            <pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[AMA Session Recap: StealthEX with Nimiq Nimiq recently conducted an AMA in collaboration with StealthEX, and we're excited to share the highlights with you. Here is the live session on X. StealthEX: Hi everyone! Today we have an AMA session with Nimiq. We'll wait a couple more minutes for more people to join. In the meantime, Ricardo, could you please introduce yourself? Ricardo: Sure! My name is Ricardo, but I go by Richy. I am from Costa Rica, so you might notice a Spanish Latin American accent. I am the communication lead at Nimiq, handling everything related to communication and marketing with the team. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions after this AMA. AMA Questions from Twitter StealthEX: Great! Let's start with some prepared questions from Twitter before moving to live questions. First, what steps is Nimiq taking to make payments with NIM as seamless as possible? How does the integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network expand the potential use cases for NIM? How does Nimiq ensure that transactions are secure and reliable? Ricardo: Nimiq is mainly focused on payments, not competing with general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum or Cardano. We enable cross-chain transactions and recently integrated Bitcoin Lightning into our payment app, Nimiq Pay. This allows users to pay with NIM at any Bitcoin Lightning acceptance location, creating a universal base for payments. Our system ensures security through decentralization and self-custodial transactions, making payments efficient and reliable. StealthEX: Fascinating. Now, the Nimiq nano node or browser node significantly improves decentralization. How does this innovation enhance the security and decentralization of the Nimiq network compared to other alternatives? Ricardo: Nimiq's wallet connects directly to the blockchain, not through a server, ensuring a decentralized peer-to-peer network. This is achieved through browser nodes, making our blockchain censorship-resistant and highly decentralized. Users can join the network easily, ensuring both security and accessibility. StealthEX: Nimiq prides itself on ease of use. Can you elaborate on the technical innovations behind the web-native approach and how it impacts user adoption and security? Ricardo: Our wallet is designed to be intuitive, like PayPal or Apple Pay, supporting NIM, Bitcoin, and USDC. We've integrated gas abstraction for USDC, allowing users to send and receive without worrying about underlying gas fees. This makes the wallet user-friendly and enhances security by keeping everything client-side. StealthEX: Given Nimiq's stateless system that does not store user data, how does the platform ensure the security and privacy of user transactions and interactions? Ricardo: We prioritize security with bug bounty programs, peer reviews, and collaborations with HackerOne. While Nimiq is not anonymous, it is pseudonymous like Bitcoin, maintaining neutrality and privacy. We also use Identicons to visually represent addresses, reducing errors and enhancing security. StealthEX: How does Nimiq's token governance model work, and how do token holders participate in the decision-making process? Ricardo: We are currently researching into governance models. So far we've gathered community feedback through on-chain polling to allow token holders to submit their preferences for important decisions. We also have a community funding board elected by the community to decide on grants and other matters. Recently, the community was polled on adjusting the supply curve, showcasing our commitment to community-driven decision-making.
(Note: the final decision of implementing any changes to the Nimiq protocol, including its parameters, always remains with the decentralized node operators who agree what version and parameters to deploy and support) StealthEX: Nimiq aims to be a widely accepted payment method. What steps are being taken to ensure compliance with AML and KYC regulations while maintaining decentralization? Ricardo: While the Nimiq blockchain itself is neutral and decentralized, we comply with regulations where necessary, such as during crowdfunding or giveaways. We follow Blockchain principles, ensuring neutrality and security. StealthEX: What updates and developments can the Nimiq community look forward to in the coming months following the migration to Proof-of-Stake? Ricardo: The migration to proof-of-stake will decrease transaction confirmation times to one second, enhancing user experience and network performance. We are also mindful of energy consumption and security, planning a phased transition similar to Ethereum's. This will include incentives and rewards for staking. StealthEX: How does Nimiq plan to attract non-crypto users to new projects? Ricardo: We are working on partnerships with major payment networks in Europe, aiming to add thousands of acceptance locations. This will make Nimiq more accessible to mainstream users, offering a familiar payment experience. We are also developing a crypto payment card to facilitate seamless transactions. StealthEX: Given Nimiq's emphasis on being web-native and developer-friendly, what initiatives are in place to attract and support developers? Ricardo: We provide grants to developers through a community-elected funding board. We also host Twitter Spaces for developer discussions and collaborations. Additionally, we are actively seeking talent to enhance our developer relations and foster more projects on the Nimiq blockchain. StealthEX: Thank you, Ricardo, for the insightful answers. Let's take some live questions now. Live Questions Question from Bull Run: What specific features for improvement can users expect from UTXO Tree, and how might it impact transaction efficiency and scalability? Ricardo: UTXO Tree combines elements from both Bitcoin's UTXO and Ethereum's account’s tree, enhancing efficiency and scalability. It allows for faster balance retrieval with minimal data, potentially enabling private transactions. We're exploring one-way private transactions to balance privacy with regulatory compliance. Question from BTC_Rat: Instead of implementing private transactions, could Nimiq do HTLC swaps with Monero and add Monero into the Nimiq wallet? Ricardo: That's an interesting idea! We are exploring various solutions, and I'll share this with our core team. It could be a feasible addition to enhance privacy and functionality. StealthEX: Thank you, Ricardo, for the great discussion. Thanks to everyone who joined. Keep an eye out for the winners of our giveaway. It was a pleasure having you all. Ricardo: Thank you for having me. Join our community and participate in our Galaxy Quest for a chance to win prizes. Stay tuned for more updates!]]></content:encoded>

For developers and open-source enthusiasts, the attestation repository is accessible here, providing all necessary files to utilize Phase 1 outputs.
 In a commitment to transparency and security, the beacon hash for this phase was set using the GitHub repository of the attestations at this commit.  Phase 2 Begins The next step in enhancing the Nimiq blockchain's security has arrived with the launch of Phase 2. Enrollment is now officially open! 
 The previous phase benefited the entire cryptocurrency space, but this next and final phase is specifically used for Nimiq Proof-of-Stake. It is vital to spread the word and encourage involvement to ensure its success.

To participate please fill out the enrollment form and join us in shaping the future of blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions As we transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 of the Nimiq ZKP Ceremony, we have compiled a list of frequently asked questions based on the inquiries and feedback from the first phase. We hope this compilation will clarify any doubts and assist participants as we continue with this critical process.
 1.1- I have enrolled for phase 1, do I have to enroll again for phase 2? Yes! Each round has a new pair of keys. The keys from phase 1 should not be reused, they should be destroyed after publishing the attestation file as instructed on the round termination post/email. To enroll in phase 2 follow the link in 1.2. 1.2- Can I still enroll in the ZKP Ceremony despite it having started already? Yes, you can! Fill out this form to enroll.  1.3- For how long will the ceremony last? And each phase and round? So far, Team Nimiq expects the full ceremony (phases 1 and 2) to take several months. Each phase is divided into several rounds until all participants have contributed. We aim to have each round lasting for a week. 1.4- How many rounds, participants/round, and how long does a round take for phases 1 and 2? Phase 1 had 9 rounds, each lasting a full week, with 20 participants enrolled. Phase 2 will work similarly. However, it is subject to change and we cannot foresee how many rounds it will have, since people are still allowed to enroll. 1.5- What are the selection criteria for the rounds? We prioritize the following:  having already contributed to Phase 1 enrolling with a Discord user that is on the server knowledge level submission order 1.6- How do I know when I am scheduled to contribute? A few days to a week before the round starts, you will receive an email with the information you need to contribute to the round. This email will have all the needed information as well as a Discord channel link. We recommend you join it for faster message exchanges between you and Team Nimiq in case assistance is needed. 1.7- Will everyone enrolled in the ceremony be assigned to a round and able to contribute? Nimiq will try to provide everyone who enrolled with the opportunity to participate in one round. This is not guaranteed because the ceremony could end up lasting up to a year. Also, it is not guaranteed that everyone will successfully contribute, since many factors can prevent a successful contribution, such as a machine and/or internet connection being too slow.
 With the transition to Proof-of-Stake around the corner, entering Phase 2 of the ZKP ceremony becomes the next vital step for our community to contribute to Nimiq's security. A big thank you to everyone who participated in Phase 1—your involvement has been crucial. We encourage you to continue with us into Phase 2.  Join Phase 2 if you haven’t already, and help spread the word to bring in as many participants as possible. Together, we can ensure this next chapter succeeds and further strengthens the Nimiq community.  Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq's vision is to make cryptocurrency payments as simple and accessible as possible while staying true to its decentralized nature. Nimiq Pay is the payment-focused mobile app designed with this ideal in mind. By combining different payment networks into a single and easy-to-use experience, Nimiq Pay is poised to bring cryptocurrency payments to the mainstream. The new version of Nimiq Pay, supporting payments at Bitcoin Lightning acceptance points, is now available for both iOS and Android. This update expands the reach of NIM payments, allowing you to use NIM wherever Bitcoin Lightning is accepted, seamlessly and effortlessly. Download or update the app today to experience the future of crypto payments. The Vision: One Single App to Pay Everywhere Cryptocurrency payments are becoming more and more popular around the world every day. Still, each cryptocurrency is building its own ecosystem with its own set of users and merchants. This brings an issue as old as the internet itself: using an app for each different network. Nimiq is all about bringing elegant and simple solutions to make cryptocurrency payments an easy experience that is on par with existing payment apps in traditional finance. Similar to TradFi, the ideal way to pay in crypto is clearly one single app that allows users to pay in every payment network out there, in a fully-self custodial way. Making it simple and straightforward for users, while hiding all the complexity under the hood. With the initial launch of Nimiq Pay, Nimiq users tasted simple and easy mobile payments in all shops accepting NIM. Nimiq's vision is to be able to pay everywhere with NIM. To take a first step forward in this direction, Nimiq Pay is now integrating the largest payment network in the crypto world: Bitcoin Lightning Network. What's Under the Hood Even though the experience of using Nimiq Pay looks simple, a lot is happening under the hood. Here is a short technical summary of everything happening behind the scenes: The merchant generates a LN invoice QR code with secret X and payment_hash = sha256(X). The QR code is scanned and the app presents the equivalent NIM amount required to the user. Those NIM are then locked into a smart contract and can be retrieved with secret X. The app simultaneously sends the merchant's invoice to Nimiq’s Multi-Asset Lightning Node (MALN). MALN fulfills the invoice using LN and by doing so learns secret X. Using secret X, MALN reimburses itself by retrieving the NIM from the smart contract. X is published on the NIM blockchain from which the app learns X. The user can prove to the merchant they paid by knowing X. Let's take a step back and compare this process to a regular Bitcoin Lightning transaction. Below is a display of a regular Lightning Network transaction that traverses the network. Notice that all sub-transactions use the same payment hash H. This ensures that all sub-transactions are either committed or reversed, guaranteeing that none of the intermediate nodes lose any funds and ensuring that the transaction either succeeds or the funds remain with the sender.  Below is a display of a Nimiq Lightning Network hybrid transaction. The process is very similar, providing the same guarantees for success or reversal as a traditional Lightning Network transaction. Most notably, the payment hash H remains the same across networks.  The Nimiq Crypto Map The Nimiq Crypto map is an ever growing registry of places that accept crypto, not just Nimiq. With this integration, the map now connects crypto users with over 3'500 places accepting payments with NIM, via Nimiq and Bitcoin Lightning. This boosts the utility of the NIM token and makes the crypto map and Nimiq Pay your one-stop-shop for self-custodial crypto payments.  What's Next As you might guess, we are working on the next payment network integrations and their order of priority for the Nimiq Pay app. If you have suggestions, feel free to drop them in the Nimiq forum or reach out to us via X. Additionally, join us LIVE on a Twitter/X Space on Friday, June 21 at 15:00 UTC to discuss The Future of Crypto Payments. We welcome crypto payment enthusiasts, Bitcoin Lightning advocates, and those passionate about crypto adoption to join! We would like to end with a word of appreciation to the Bitcoin community and invite them to try out our tech and find out why Nimiq is becoming the closest crypto to Bitcoin. Pura Vida,

            <description><![CDATA[The final stage in the migration to Nimiq Proof of Stake (PoS) is here. This post provides a concise guide to the essent]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post specifically addresses validator operators participating in the PoS migration. For general information on the migration, see this post: What You Need to Know About Nimiq's Migration to Proof of Stake.  You can find the full documentation here. Below is a short summary of the next steps for validator operators. Steps for Validator Operators Main Prerequisite: Validator Registration: Your validator needs to be registered and appear on this list. 1. Join the Validator Operator's Chat Join Nimiq’s Discord or Telegram. Reach out to a Moderator/Team Member to verify yourself as a validator operator. 2. Install the Latest PoW Release, now version 1.6.4, which was released on November 13, 2024. Download the code here or access compiled binaries here. Syncing Shortcut: Download a snapshot via IPFS or Torrent, extract it, and place it in your PoW client directory to speed up sync time. If using a third-party source, verify it with this SHA256 hash:  <code style="font-family: Fira Code; background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.06);padding: 4px;border-radius: 4px;color: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.8);font-size: 0.8em;">97fba2d6a9c8eaeb5fe568337e8052097fdffaae3f047b2f283e7007f30851cf  pow-main-full-consensus.zip</code> 3. Download the Latest PoS Release, now 1.0.0-rc.5, which was released on November 17, 2024. Download it here. 4. Verify your Configuration Configure client.toml with your validator data as explained in Step 1 of the Activation Guide.  Verify that the seed list matches the list provided in the client.example.toml. The same list is provided below for confirmation: <pre style="font-family: Fira Code; background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.06);padding: 12px;border-radius: 4px;color: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.8);font-size: 0.8em;">seed_nodes = [
  { address = "/dns4/aurora.seed.nimiq.com/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/catalyst.seed.nimiq.network/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/cipher.seed.nimiq-network.com/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/eclipse.seed.nimiq.cloud/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/lumina.seed.nimiq.systems/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/nebula.seed.nimiq.com/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/nexus.seed.nimiq.network/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/polaris.seed.nimiq-network.com/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/photon.seed.nimiq.cloud/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/pulsar.seed.nimiq.systems/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/quasar.seed.nimiq.com/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/solstice.seed.nimiq.network/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/vortex.seed.nimiq.cloud/tcp/443/wss" },
  { address = "/dns4/zenith.seed.nimiq.systems/tcp/443/wss" },
]</pre>  Verify the network configuration entry is set to main-albatross as provided in the client.example.toml. The final configuration should be the same one as below <code style="font-family: Fira Code; background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.06);padding: 4px;border-radius: 4px;color: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.8);font-size: 0.8em;">network = "main-albatross"</code>  5. Compile the PoS Client Compile the PoS client as explained in Step 4 of the Activation Guide.  6. Run the Activation Tool The activation tool will stay active until the end of the migration. It will signal “online” starting approximately 3 days before the candidate block at Proof of Work block #3’456’000.  Once your validator “online” signal has been sent, it will appear as ONLINE on the Migration Readiness Monitor. When the Activation Phase opens and your validator produces a Genesis Hash, it will appear as READY on the Migration Readiness Monitor. When more than 80% of the total stake has signaled readiness with the same Genesis Hash, the PoS chain will go live, and validators will begin producing blocks. Remember to start this process as early as possible to ensure a smooth migration to Proof of Stake. Your dedication and support are invaluable in making this transition a success. Thank you for being an essential part of this journey. See you on the Proof of Stake Network!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nimiq Pre-Staking Campaign phase has come to an end, marking an exciting milestone on Nimiq’s path to Proof of Stake. Thanks to the overwhelming support of the Nimiq community, the base goal of 2 billion NIM was met in just 48 hours, ensuring a robust migration to Proof of Stake. Since then, the pre-staked amount has grown substantially, with over 5.7 billion NIM pre-staked by more than 1300 addresses. With over 48% of all NIM in circulation staked, this reflects the strong commitment from the Nimiq community for the migration to Proof of Stake. For some context, Ethereum holders had staked an estimated 13% of total supply at the time of transition from proof of work to proof of stake (though an individual minimum of 32ETH was required while Nimiq requires only 100 NIM). A huge thank you to everyone who participated! The focus now shifts to the Activation Phase, scheduled to commence on November 19, 2024, at approximately 8:00 AM UTC, corresponding to block #3’456’000 on the Proof of Work chain. Nimiq Proof of Stake Is Imminent—What Do I Need to Do? For users not operating a validator, the migration is expected to be seamless. No action is required on your part unless you are going to operate a validator during the migration. Your NIM will remain safe, and you can continue using your wallet as usual once the migration is complete. All possible precautions have been taken to ensure completion within an hour after the activation window opens approximately on November 19 at 8:00 am UTC, when block #3’456’000 is mined in PoW. However, as this is a decentralized process (read Start of the PoS Mainnet Chain​ from the Nimiq Developer Center to learn more), initiated by network validators and supported by community developers globally, there is a chance that not all validators will be ready when the activation window opens. If you're curious about what happens if some validators are not ready in time, please refer to the section below, What to Expect if Multiple Activation Windows Are Needed. If everything goes as expected, the required validators are ready and the migration process starts as soon as the activation window opens, here’s what to expect: Nimiq Wallet: The Nimiq Wallet will display a warning and temporarily disable transactions during the migration. This transaction closure will start approximately 1 hour before the candidate block (Block 3'456'000 from the Proof of Work Chain is used as the candidate block) and ends 1 hour after the Migration has concluded. There is no risk of users losing their funds. This precaution ensures that all transactions made close to the candidate block are properly reflected in the Proof of Stake Genesis Block. This way, users experience a smooth and accurate preservation of transaction history during the critical migration period. Exchanges: Exchanges supporting NIM are expected to halt deposits and withdrawals 24 hours prior to the migration. They will resume these services once the migration is successfully completed and the network is stable. Activation Phase Technical Details For those interested in the technical aspects, below is an explanation of what to expect during the Activation Phase. As soon as the Activation Phase begins at Proof of Work Block #3’456’000, that very block will be used as the candidate transition block, initiating a 24-hour window for the transition to Proof of Stake with that block’s state. Validators who registered during the Validator Registration Phase will be able to signal their readiness to migrate during this period. The transition will only occur once validators representing 80% or more of the total pre-staked NIM signal readiness. If the readiness threshold is not met within the 24-hour window for unexpected reasons, the activation will reset, and a new candidate transition block will be selected for another activation attempt. Given the strong support from community-managed pools, a successful transition within the first activation window can be anticipated. However, every scenario must be considered, and therefore the protocol is designed to handle multiple attempts if necessary to ensure a secure transition. For those curious about the process in case multiple activation windows are required, continue reading. What to Expect if Multiple Activation Windows Are Needed Even if validators have issues signaling readiness, the migration process is designed with that possibility in mind. To ensure a smooth transition, validators will signal their online state starting 3 days before the first activation window at block height 3’456’000. Once 80% of the total stake signals readiness, the PoS chain launches. If this threshold isn’t reached in the first window, additional 24-hours windows will open every 1’400 PoW blocks. By the 5th window, validators who have not shown readiness are removed from the count, increasing the likelihood of reaching the 80% threshold. These removed validators will be deactivated for the first epoch of the PoS chain but can resume their active state from the second epoch onwards. This process continues until the 80% is reached. For more information, visit the Migration Section in the Nimiq Developer Center. Pre-Staking Campaign Rewards and Giveaways With the Pre-Staking Phase concluded, our attention now turns to ensuring a successful migration to Proof of Stake. After the migration is confirmed, exchanges and third-party wallets are operational, and the new Proof of Stake chain is stable, we will begin distributing Pre-staking rewards and selecting giveaway winners. As stated in the Pre-staking Campaign, this process may take up to three months following the migration. Stay tuned to Nimiq's official channels for updates on pre-staking rewards and giveaways. What's Next? Exciting developments are on the horizon! With the transition to Proof of Stake, we will launch initiatives aimed at driving mass adoption of crypto payments and continue to grow the Nimiq community through engaging events. We extend our deepest gratitude to all who have supported us on this journey. The best of Nimiq is yet to come.  See you on the Proof of Stake network!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today marks a historic milestone for Nimiq: the successful migration to Proof of Stake (PoS). This upgrade represents a major step forward, making the Nimiq blockchain more energy-efficient, faster and capable of higher performance, all-the-while not compromising on decentralization! With Proof of Stake now live, Nimiq is more equipped than ever to deliver on its vision of making self-custodial blockchain payments accessible for everyone. To experience the new Proof of Stake network firsthand, you can explore its features through the Nimiq Wallet. The wallet provides an intuitive, self-custodial platform where you can stake your NIM, track rewards, and manage your funds in NIM, BTC and USDC or USDT on Polygon. And as native web app it is App Store censorship resistant accessible from anywhere, anytime with nothing more than a browser. Additionally, the community-built NimiqHub offers detailed insights into block generation, rewards, and validator activity. With the Proof of Stake upgrade now live, the Nimiq community can actively participate in securing the network through staking. This new feature not only enhances decentralization but also rewards users for supporting the Nimiq Network. If you’re wondering how to begin staking or what to expect, here’s basic information to get you started. You can find more details in the Staking FAQ. How NIM Staking Works Staking is now live, and anyone can participate with as little as 100 NIM. When you delegate your NIM to a validator or staking pool, your funds help secure the network. Validators earn rewards for their work and, in case of a staking pool, these rewards can then also be shared with stakers. If you’re wondering how much you can earn, check out Nimiq’s staking calculator to estimate your potential rewards. Remember, your staked funds always remain under your ownership and can be redelegated if needed. When selecting a Staking Pool, consider the following factors to make an informed decision: Pool Fee: Pools charge a fee for maintaining and operating the validator infrastructure. Compare the fees of different pools to find one that aligns with your preferences. Decentralization: A well-distributed stake ensures a healthy and secure Proof of Stake network. Each pool is assigned a score, indicating how staking with them contributes to the overall balance of the network. Pool-Specific Features: Explore the unique features offered by each pool. Some pools may provide benefits like automatic re-staking, dynamic fees, or additional services. Check their websites or connect with their community on Nimiq’s Discord to learn more. Ensuring Network Integrity The Proof of Stake protocol incentivizes good behavior among validators through a system of rewards and penalties. Validators are rewarded for producing blocks and following consensus rules. However, misbehaving validators can face penalties, such as temporary “jailing” for up to four days, during which they cannot participate or earn rewards. This system ensures the security and reliability of the network. If a validator you’re staking with goes offline, you won’t lose your funds, but you may temporarily stop earning rewards. In such cases, you can redelegate your NIM to another validator to continue earning rewards. Important Information While the migration unlocks exciting opportunities, some key updates are important to note during this transition period: Ledger Support A new version of the Ledger Nimiq app has been released, now supporting Nimiq Proof of Stake and Ledger’s latest devices, the Ledger Stax and Flex. This updated app allows you to send and receive NIM on the Nimiq Proof of Stake blockchain. However, staking and un-staking are not yet supported. Stay tuned—these features will be available in a future update! Updates for Trust Wallet Users Trust Wallet is supporting the Proof of Stake migration and will resume NIM transactions within the next few hours. This ensures that users relying on Trust Wallet can continue managing their NIM without disruption. Nimiq Pay Updates to the Nimiq Pay app require approval from Google and Apple stores, which may take a few days to complete. Bitcoin Lightning payments in Nimiq Pay are paused until the updated app version becomes available. Exchanges and Third-Party Services Exchanges supporting NIM, as well as exchange aggregators like Stealthex, Swapzone, and others, have paused deposits and withdrawals during the migration. These services will resume as soon as the Proof of Stake network stabilizes. Be sure to follow Nimiq’s X account for updates on the status of exchanges and other third-party services. Pre-Staking Rewards and Giveaways The migration marks the end of the pre-staking phase. Rewards from this program, along with giveaways, will be processed once the network is stable and exchanges are operational. Distribution may take up to three months to complete, so stay tuned for updates. The Journey Ahead The migration to Proof of Stake is just the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Nimiq. This upgrade unlocks huge possibilities, from broader adoption to new marketing and product initiatives. Stay connected with Nimiq on X for updates on upcoming features, and exciting developments.  Before we conclude, we want to express our deepest gratitude to all Nimiq supporters. A special thank you goes out to the incredible community developers running validators—your dedication and hard work have made this historic milestone possible.  Welcome to the future of blockchain payments—Nimiq Proof of Stake is here!

            <description><![CDATA[New report for the period following July 2022]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In line with the last report, we would like to present an updated overview of the assets and use of funds for the Nimiq project, as well as updated details of the distribution of NIM tokens and the circulating supply. The period covered since the last report is August 1, 2022 through July 31, 2023. The report indicates a steady burn-rate as well as a smaller than expected decrease in net assets due to mildly favorable crypto market value developments and diversification. Assets and use of funds Assets The Nimiq Project continues to hold a variety of liquid and non-liquid assets. The 9.9% stake in German TEN31 (WEG) Bank AG was revalued based on recent divestments of the bank from the crypto sector. Similarly the real estate holdings were updated based on current market value estimates. As of publication of the report the Nimiq Project had the following assets: 176.1 BTC ~ US$ 5.16 Mio 1’405.4 ETH ~ US$ 2.59 Mio 403.0 Mio NIM (besides genesis NIM) ~ US$ 0.36 Mio EUR, USD & USDC ~ US$ 1.35 Mio Stake in TEN31 (WEG) Bank ~ US$ 2.50 Mio (reassessed) Real Estate ~ US$ 2.20 Mio (reassessed) Loan to ImpactX Foundation: ~ US$ 33.8K Reserves (see "Use of funds") ~ US$ (-0.36 Mio) Total Net Assets: ~US$ 13.76 Mio  Use of funds The use of funds from the end of July 2022 up to the end of July 2023 breaks down as follows: Product Development Contracting, Compensations: This includes all research, design, implementation and maintenance work regarding the Nimiq protocol on its way to switching from Proof-of-work to Proof-of-stake, the Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme (OASIS), Cryptopayment Link, Crypto Map, the Nimiq Pay App and related apps and systems. The report indicates stable contracting expenses and team size. Going forward a reasonable increase may be incurred due to continued growth of the team and inflation adjusted compensations. An additional amount of ~US$ 260K continues to be reserved and due pending achievement of development goals (release of Proof of Stake for Nimiq, etc). ~US$ 1’666.7K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~52.9% of total (~61.6% of non-extraordinary) Marketing, Content, Community: This includes expenses related to creating and distributing educational video and written content, branding and sponsorships, swag production, user and consumer surveys, community rewards and campaigns, social media management and industry conference expenses. It also includes the membership contribution to the Blockchain for Europe organization and supporting the European “Kryptostadt” and Latin American “Criptociudad” ( translate into “Cryptocity”) efforts that aid NIM adoption. In addition, this covers community programs such as the Bug Bounty Program and the Community Project Funding with a reserve of US$ 50K for the next 12 months. An amount of US$ 50K is reserved and due pending listing related pre-staking provisions. ~US$ 383.3K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~12.2% of total (~14.2% of non-extraordinary) Legal, Administration, Taxes: This includes legal, tax and administrative expenses regarding corporate maintenance, contract review, accounting, professional support from Lara Legal Corp, Annerton and additional task specific international legal counsel i.e. for pursuing required licenses, trademarking, terms of services, privacy policies, legal memorandums, etc. ~US$ 136.9K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~4.3% of total (~5.1% of non-extraordinary) Digital Operations, Equipment: This includes expenses related to hosting, hardware, software, licensing, communications, domains, and other development tools and platforms.  ~US$ 144.3K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~4.6% of total (~5.3% of non-extraordinary) Travel, F&B: This includes expenses related to transportation, hotel, food/beverage, and team building.  ~US$ 193.8K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~6.2% of total (~7.2% of non-extraordinary) Physical Operations, Rent: This includes expenses related to workspace, hackathon accommodation, and maintenance. ~US$ 182.3K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~5.8% of total (~6.7% of non-extraordinary) Extraordinary: This includes fees for listing integration efforts and continued setup of the technology and infrastructure as a service for Nimiq OASIS. ~US$ 441.5K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~14.0% of total Total Use of Funds: ~US$ 3’148.8K (2’707.3K non-extraordinary) The monthly burn-rate average comes in at ~US$ 230K (excluding extraordinary expenses) and as such matches the level of the previous reporting period. While total expenses related to Product Development Contracting, Compensations have held steady, they recently increased due to the hiring of additional highly qualified contributors, including core, frontend and business developers, which should reasonably reflect in next year's report. However given these new engagements, the long-standing team has reached a quality and capacity such that no further hires are anticipated at this time. Marketing, Community, Content expenses were lower than the prior reporting period, which is mostly attributable to the holding pattern the project is in as it gets closer to releasing the Proof-of-Stake upgrade and a rerelease of OASIS with new payment service partners. With the increased support of open efforts such as the European “Kryptostadt” and Latin American “Criptociudad”, as well as creating awareness around Cryptopayment Link, all of which encourage the adoption of NIM, BTC and USDC in the payment acceptance and crypto holding process, we expect a reasonable increase in this expense category going forward. Expenses related to Legal, Administration, Taxes, and Physical Operations, Rent are holding steady. The relative increase in Digital Operations, Equipment is attributable to domain acquisitions and equipment replacement. The relative increase in Travel, F&B is attributable to higher prices for travel and an increase in international event and hackathon attendance. NIM supply and distribution This second part describes the distribution of NIM tokens, showing details of accounts and vesting contracts as well as the circulating and total supply as of the end of July. Quick view Live summary of NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply.txt The total final NIM supply over ~100 years by design of the Nimiq Blockchain Proof-of-Work protocol (see Nimiq Whitepaper 1.0): 21'000'000'000 NIM. The circulating supply as of the end of July was ~11’001’300’000 NIM (~52.4% of final total). Details NIM activated from Token Sale NET (5% of final total): As of the end of July 2022, 861’049’052 NIM have been activated from NET and are part of the circulating supply. The remaining difference (~188’950’948 NIM) that has not been activated from NET is visible at account addresses NQ69 9A4A MB83 HXDQ 4J46 BH5R 4JFF QMA9 C3GN, NQ15 MLJN 23YB 8FBM 61TN 7LYG 2212 LVBG 4V19 and NQ17 YTX4 X5U6 5BUX HN5J V6VV 260V 9UP1 D39S. Though the deadline for activating NIM has long passed, Nimiq is processing requests on a case by case, manual basis (applying the same conditions of KYC/AML). Being conservative, Nimiq considers them part of the circulating supply. All other NIM are either acquired through mining or released through a vesting contract as further described below (all vesting durations are measured from April 14 2018). NIM minable (88% of final total): 18'480'000'000 NIM over ~100 years since April 2018. As of the end of July: ~8’957’000’000 NIM (~42.7% of final total) are part of the circulating supply. The live amount mined to date is available here: http://nim.sh/stats/supply/mined/nim.txt Nimiq Foundation (Project, 2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ09 VF5Y 1PKV MRM4 5LE1 55KV P6R2 GXYJ XYQF. Vesting is 26'250'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 262’500’000 NIM (1.25% of final total) are available and part of the circulating supply. These funds have not been touched to date. ImpactX Foundation (Charity, 2% of final total): 420'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ19 YG54 46TX EHGQ D2R2 V8XA JX84 UFG0 S0MC. Vesting is 21'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 210’000’000 NIM (1.25% of final total) are available and part of the circulating supply. These funds have not been touched to date. In June 2021 a US$ 33’780 (1 BTC) donation was made to the charity: water’s bitcoin trust with an interest-rate-free loan from Nimiq to the ImpactX Foundation. Nimiq Team & Early Contributors (2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at 82 vesting contract addresses, see https://pastebin.com/raw/1eDwDF45. Vesting schedule A (for creators) was 35'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 3 years and vesting schedule B was 157'500'000 NIM month 3 and month 6 (team, early contributors and future team member allocation).

            <description><![CDATA[We are ready to talk about and introduce to you the all new native mobile app named "Nimiq Pay". It is entering late sta]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq's grand vision is to provide an easy-to-use means of payment that retains the self-custodial nature, censorship-resistance, and decentralized aspects inherent to properly conceived cryptocurrencies. As smartphones dominate our daily lives, especially in financial transactions, it's only natural for Nimiq to expand in this direction. An App Designed for Physical Point-of-Sale Payments  The Nimiq Wallet (web) app is designed as the most censorship-resistant and globally accessible way to manage your NIM, BTC and USDC in a self-custodial manner. The native mobile case is already different, simply through the fact that it requires passing through app store requirements and having app store access as a user. So we took the opportunity to focus the Nimiq Pay app specifically on the mobile payment use case: INSTANT payment at a physical point-of-sale while maintaining self-custody. This app is designed to harness the full potential of native mobile capabilities such as NFC, fingerprint, face recognition, and beyond. Our primary goal is to introduce an app that becomes an essential instrument for daily transactions.  Our brainstorming sessions for Nimiq Pay have indeed been a melting pot of innovative ideas and possibilities:  A Diverse Range of Payment Methods  Point-of-Sale payments are all about speed and convenience. Recognizing the importance of multiple payment avenues, we're exploring integrations of various methods into Nimiq Pay. Through innovative technologies like OASIS/SuperSimpleSwap, we're set on giving users the freedom to use their NIM even in places that traditionally accept other payment methods, broadening the scope of NIM's application.  We cannot disclose the specifics of these payment methods at the moment. However, we are committed to sharing updates as soon as possible.  Integration with Nimiq Crypto Map  Locating places that accept NIM should be as easy as finding a coffee shop nearby. We're in the process of fine-tuning the Nimiq Crypto Map for mobile users, ensuring that they can swiftly identify establishments and services that welcome NIM. It’s not just a tool for our users, it's an opportunity for businesses to tap into the thriving world of cryptocurrency.  You can track our progress with this initiative at map.nimiq.com. Keep an eye out for more updates, and if you're aware of any stores that should be on our map, please don't hesitate to reach out to us!  Incentives through Cashback and Bonus Points:  The user choice of one form of payment over another is often tied to incentives provided to the user. As a first in crypto, Nimiq Pay will introduce a way for Sponsors to unlock a rewards program for users. We’re building and integrating the infrastructure that supports a form of “loyalty” program, which will allow Sponsors to target specific areas (cities, etc) or merchants (brands, etc) with adoption campaigns. Users that opt-in may receive cashbacks from transactions and bonus points by spending their NIM at sponsored locations and engaging with the app, learning more about the Nimiq ecosystem, or participating in tasks. 
While a first campaign sponsor is already secured, this feature is an open initiative: it will be open to businesses and community members who might want to sponsor a campaign in their city, ensuring a collaborative growth of the Nimiq ecosystem. We are still in the optimization phase of the program, and encourage Nimiq Community Ambassadors from across the globe to reach out and inquire about adoption campaigns and how sponsoring will work!  What's Next?  Nimiq Pay has already entered it's late development stage, with our team putting in their best efforts to realize the vision we've set. We'll keep you updated as significant milestones are reached. We appreciate the continued trust and support of our community and are eager to present a first version of Nimiq Pay that you can test out. Stay tuned, and here's to the exciting journey ahead!  Pura Vida

            <description><![CDATA[As Nimiq prepares for its upgrade to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), attention is once again drawn to a pivotal element: the suppl]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The original and still current emission rate curve for Nimiq (Proof-of-Work) was chosen to mirror Bitcoin's supply curve. Following the launch of the Nimiq Mainnet, the community advocated revisiting the emission curve to align with the then expected switch to Proof-of-Stake. After a diligent public voting process where NIM holders' votes were recorded on the Nimiq Blockchain, a new emission curve was elected and has since been waiting for release with the pending switch to Proof-of-Stake.  Now, as Nimiq Proof-of-Stake is close to being launched, but has taken much longer than expected to implement, there is a reasonable need to reconsider this selected “Blue Curve”. Adjustments need to be made for it to suit the conditions of the ensuing Proof-of-Stake reward economy in the context of the current and future circulating supply. Let’s start by revisiting some of the assumptions and restrictions shared in the previous blog post related to the supply curve adjustment discussion. Key principles for adjusting the curve: The “coin supply growth” is effectively equal to the “network reward” (or “total reward”) emitted in time. Such rewards for validators are calculated based on real-world time, not on number of blocks (the percentage of coins staked from total supply does not affect the absolute emission rate). The aim remains to reach a total supply of 21 billion NIM approximately 100 years from the time of mainnet launch in 2018.  The growth rate should continue to accommodate for the concept that, following the introduction of a currency, the earlier years support higher supply growth than the later years, when some level of saturation has been achieved.  The supply growth should be closer to the generally accepted economic ideal of a monetary system with (positive) smaller, steadier rate changes. Any adjustment should consider the continued community expectation that the annualized coin supply growth should be smaller than it is now. The initial staking reward (adjusted and non-adjusted) should compare reasonably within the ranges of other current PoS projects of similar maturity, for competitive reasons. Adjusting the curve with minimal changes The Proof-of-Work emission to date has pushed the NIM supply to a level where the community-chosen curve for Proof-of-Stake emission requires adjustment. In simple terms, going with the elected curve would lead to reaching the original target of a 21 billion NIM total supply much sooner than anticipated.  This situation calls for an adjustment of the emission curve to reasonably maintain the intended reward balance and supply growth in time. To minimize changes to the elected curve we strive to keep as many parameters as possible fixed from the outcome of the original vote. The first option would be to keep the initial absolute reward rate (525/min). The second option would be to keep the first year emission percentage target (“Inflation”), which is derived from the planned annual supply growth which was 4.1%. While maintaining the 21 billion total supply target (reached in now 94 years), this means the only adjustment needed is the annualized reduction in reward. To align the previously selected supply curve with the current scenario, we compare these two main approaches:  A. Maintain initial absolute NIM reward By keeping the initial emission at the same level as previously selected (525 NIM/min), the original annual reward reduction percentage  of 1.47% would need to be increased to approximately 3%. This adjustment means that each year, the reward would lower a bit more than originally elected, extending the timeline to reach the total supply target.  B. Maintain Initial annual supply growth Alternatively, by keeping the initial annual supply growth (“Inflation”) at the same level as previously selected (4.1%)),  the initial emission would need to be increased to around 1000 NIM per minute. This approach means more NIM would be distributed initially, but to reach the same total supply target, the reward would have to be decreasing faster, with the annual reduction rate increased to approximately 6%.  The two approaches and its parameters offer boundary choices between the original intent and the current Nimiq tokenomics.  Give it a try Want to experiment and discover your own curve to make a proposal to the community? Give it a try here:  <iframe style="width: min(1440px, calc(100vw - 16px)); margin-left:-24px;aspect-ratio:9 / 12"  src="https://mraveux.github.io/supply-curve/" class="md:hidden"></iframe> <iframe style="width: min(1440px, calc(100vw - 16px)); margin-left:-50%;"  src="https://mraveux.github.io/supply-curve/" class=" hidden md:flex"></iframe>
 The Next Step  Based on these considerations, Team Nimiq invites the community to engage in a ~30-day discussion period until March 20 2024 across Nimiq Community Channels and the Nimiq Community Forum to affirm either of these approaches or present additional options. Following this period of discourse and the leading resulting supply curve options, Team Nimiq will organize a voting procedure similar to the previous one, enabling Nimiq community stakeholders to participate and cast their votes.
 This important phase in Nimiq's story is one where the community's voice has always played a significant role in guiding the path towards a balanced, resilient, and community-driven future.
 Thank you for your support and pura vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[As the Nimiq network transitions to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, the journey is marked by significant developme]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello Nimiq Community,  The topic at hand is the much-anticipated shift from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. This transition is not merely a change in how transactions are validated and blocks are created; it's a new era for the Nimiq ecosystem, fostering a more inclusive and environmentally conscious network. For those who have been part of the community since its inception, this change represents a realization of long-term goals and vision. For newcomers, it's an invitation to be part of a forward-thinking and adaptive community.  This article aims to shed light on the intricacies of the migration process, detailing the steps and actions required for NIM holders and the broader community. To set the stage clearly: Only users who want to actively participate in the transition process by registering as validators or pre-staking to a registered validator are required to act upon the steps outlined below. Participants aspiring to be validators at the inception of the Proof-of-Stake chain, or those interested in the migration process, do read on. The migration will proceed through distinct stages:  Phase 1: Registration   The migration starts with the registration phase on the PoW chain, where users can register as validators for the upcoming PoS blockchain. This phase is set to compile the initial validator list of the PoS chain. The first phase will run for a predetermined time window, denoted by a fixed number of blocks. In this window, each aspiring validator sends a set of transactions carrying the validator's specific data. Committing to that data by sending the validator minimum deposit will then make them eligible to become a validator for the transition. Registering as a validator is a one-way ticket to the PoS chain, and there is no option of withdrawing the deposit. Furthermore, failure to fulfill the validator duties will result in penalties, emphasizing the commitment required in this role. Phase 2: Pre-stake  Following the registration phase, the network will enter the pre-stake phase within a specified block window. This stage is meant to register stake delegation to the validators, who have pre-registered in Phase 1. Any user can delegate their NIM to any registered validator, allowing them to participate in the consensus and earn rewards without direct (technical) involvement. Validators can also increase their stake by pre-staking additional NIM to their own validator address or to other validators’ addresses. It is important to note that pre-stake transactions are final until the Proof of Stake chain is launched. There will be no opportunity to withdraw or reallocate staked NIM until the completion of the migration.  A new feature will be added to the wallet, enabling users to easily execute pre-stake transactions to a curated list of pre-registered validators. A tally of all allocated stake will be published once this phase concludes. Phase 3: Activation   The culmination of the migration is the activation phase. During this stage, pre-registered validators indicate their readiness for the PoS transition through a specific transaction. This phase starts at a specific block height which is then followed by an activation window. This window concludes in a block number that neatly aligns with an election block number on the PoS chain. If at least 80% of the allocated stake signals readiness within an activation window, the corresponding block is designated as the transition block.   The network will then snapshot its state to generate the genesis block of the PoS chain, ensuring continuity and a seamless transition. Should the first activation window not meet the readiness criterion, subsequent windows will open until the 80% threshold is reached, each spanning a period equivalent to a day's worth of PoW blocks.  Upon reaching 80% readiness, the transition block state is captured to initiate the genesis block of the PoS chain, mirroring the block number and state to ensure a smooth transfer. The transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake is not merely a change in consensus mechanism. It involves the meticulous capture of the entire PoW state, converting it into readable data on the PoS chain. The validators' deposit and the delegated stake will transition into the PoS chain. Preservation of every transaction and account is ensured in this process. Phase 4: Launch of Nimiq PoS By this point, validators will then abide by a waiting period for confirmations within the PoW chain to ensure that the state of the transition block is final. The genesis block will then be generated with the state captured from the transition block.  After this, the PoS blockchain officially launches, and validators start the block production as per the Albatross protocol specification. 🎉  If some miners and users want to keep using the PoW chain even after launching the PoS chain, they can continue doing so. It is important to note that for the migration, only the transition block is considered the latest state of the PoW blockchain. This block serves as the Snapshot from PoW, capturing the state of the network at the moment of transition. Moving forward, the PoS chain will operate independently from the previous PoW chain.  This marks a pivotal evolution for Nimiq, and more comprehensive details will be released to ensure community members are well-informed and prepared. The enthusiasm and support from the Nimiq community have been instrumental in this journey, and as the network approaches this new chapter, the anticipation and collaborative spirit are more palpable than ever. We can’t thank you enough for your support.  Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the wake of the consideration phase detailed in the previous blog post “Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Supply Curve Update”, the stage has been set for a pivotal voting process. This process is designed to determine the future of the Nimiq supply curve as it transitions to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).  Starting on Thursday March 28, 2024, every stakeholder of the Nimiq community will have the opportunity to participate in a vote on three curve options for the PoS supply curve adjustment (plus the choice to not go with any of these options). The voting process will remain open until the end of Saturday April 13 UTC (block #3141223), and will be facilitated through the use of Nimiq wallets. NIM holders will be able to cast their votes in a transparent and verifiable manner on the Nimiq Blockchain by visiting the voting website.  The Options for Voting  Based on the detailed insights shared in the previous blog post regarding the transition of Nimiq to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and the thoughtful dialogue that followed within the community, a comprehensive understanding has been achieved.   The options presented for the upcoming voting process have been discussed thoroughly, taking into account the suggestions and diverse perspectives and insights shared by community members. The main challenge is to balance the long-term sustainability of the network with the competitive dynamics of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, ensuring that Nimiq remains at the forefront of innovation: Option A. The Preservation of the Initial Absolute NIM Reward (GREEN Curve), as per the outcome of the emission curve vote from 2020: This option proposes the retention of the initial emission rate at 525 NIM per minute, adjusting the annual reward reduction percentage to about 3% to extend the timeline for reaching the total supply target in ~94 years.  Option B. The Preservation of Initial Annual Supply Growth (RED Curve), as per the outcome of the emission curve vote from 2020: This approach aims to maintain the initial annual supply growth rate at 4.1%, which equates to an initial absolute emission of approximately 1000 NIM per minute. To adhere to the envisioned total supply target within the projected timeline, this would require an accelerated decrease in rewards, with the annual reduction rate heightened to about 6%.  Option C. The Current and Original Emission Curve (GRAY Curve): This option suggests maintaining the current Proof-of-Work emission curve, without any emission rate changes for the transition to Proof-of-Stake.The PoS staking reward per minute would match the current reward per block and its reduction in time. This choice reflects a commitment to the original parameters set at the network's inception, emphasizing stability and continuity in the emission strategy.   Option D. None of the above Voting for this choice means there is further need for discussion. It would be up to the community to decide what happens then, which may result in a new vote or something else. It should be noted that this very likely would cause a delay of the switch to proof-of-stake as it may take quite a while to establish consensus.  Instructions for Participation The process for participating in the vote is designed to be straightforward: Commencing March 28, 2024, the community is invited to visit the voting website. Voters will utilize their Nimiq wallet to register their vote by signing a 1 Luna (0.00001 NIM) transaction with the vote embedded as a message. Each vote will be securely recorded on the Nimiq Blockchain, ensuring that it can not be manipulated as well as that it can be independently verified. The voting window will remain open until the end of April 13 UTC, 2024 (block #3141223), offering ample opportunity for community engagement. IMPORTANT:  You can NOT vote with funds held in exchanges or third-party wallets as these do not support the required custom public messages in transactions, which are needed for the vote to be recorded on the blockchain. You can also not vote with funds in vesting contracts (please move available funds to a regular account address first). Your vote will be automatically submitted through the Nimiq Voting app by sending 1 Luna (= 0.00001 NIM) to the preset burn address (an address that will be derived by the voting app based on the hash of the voting setup. This makes it verifiable that the setup is not changed during or after voting). The transaction contains the vote in the form of a public message recorded on the blockchain. What counts is the balance (1 NIM = 1 Vote) on your voting address AT THE CLOSING OF THE VOTE WHEN A SNAPSHOT OF THE BLOCKCHAIN IS TAKEN AT THE FINAL BLOCK. For example: if you submit a vote and then move the funds away from that address before the end of the voting period, the balance on that address will be zero, equivalent to no votes. Note that of course, you can vote again with your new address that now has the balance. This prevents anyone from using their balance(s) more than once. You can change your vote by voting again with the same address. Only the last vote of an address counts, at the end of the voting period, with the balance it has at that time. Do not wait until the last minute to submit your vote. Things always take longer than expected and this way you can also correct your vote in case you made a mistake or changed your mind by re-submitting your vote. Please follow our social media for announcements of any unexpected changes to this timeline. Step-by-step Guide  Step 1: Visit the Vote App   Step 2: Rank the choices The curve choices are randomized in their position when you enter the voting app. Drag them into the order of your preference before submitting your vote. You can read more about the curves in the latest Blog post as well as this forum discussion.  Step 3: Select your address When you have finalized your ranking, click “Vote”. The familiar Nimiq Checkout dialog will appear. If you have multiple addresses, you will be asked to select one.  Step 4: Submit your Vote After selecting your address, you will be prompted for your password. If you are voting with an address stored on a Ledger hardware wallet, connect your Ledger and confirm the transaction in the Ledger Nimiq app. After you confirm, the transaction will be processed and your vote recorded on the Nimiq Blockchain.  Step 5: See the Results After your vote has been submitted, you will be able to see the preliminary results. Note that your vote will take a few minutes to be recorded on the blockchain and enter the calculations. You can still vote again if you change your mind. Also, you can vote with every address that has a balance to maximize your vote (instead of moving all your NIM to a single address to vote from). Only the address balances at the end of the voting period count towards the vote. In other words, for your voting balance to count, do not move your funds before the end of the vote.  What’s Next? The vote is scheduled to commence on Thursday, March 28th, at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.   All official information and results will be shared through Nimiq’s Twitter account, ensuring the community remains informed. Make sure to stay tuned for updates. Huge thanks to the entire community for their invaluable support on this journey. It is now more important than ever to spread the word about this pivotal voting process—please share this opportunity with everyone you know, inviting them to take part in shaping the future of Nimiq.  Pura Vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Celebrating Six Years of the Nimiq Blockchain The Nimiq Blockchain is nearing its sixth anniversary, continuing its legacy of reliable and community-powered transactions. The upcoming year is set to be transformative with the upgrade to Proof-of-Stake. This significant shift has been in the pipeline for years and is designed to dramatically reduce energy consumption while boosting the speed and performance of the blockchain—factors that contribute to a seamless payment experience. Advancing to Proof-of-Stake The Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol has advanced to a level of maturity that is now ready for extensive and rigorous testing. This is a significant moment for the Nimiq community and team alike as we embark on a series of planned phases to evaluate and refine the migration process. These tests are crucial—they allow our developers to collect valuable data, identify any potential issues, and ensure that everything functions as expected. The active participation of the community in this testing phase is vital, as it not only aids in optimizing the protocol but also strengthens the network by ensuring a seamless and robust migration for all users. 1. Public Bug Bounty with HackerOne HackerOne will conduct a public bug bounty program for the entire Nimiq Proof-of-Stake codebase. This initiative follows a private security audit and aims to engage the community in helping identify vulnerabilities, ensuring a robust and secure migration. 2. Community Test of the Migration Process This hands-on test will allow community members to actively participate and experience the migration process firsthand. Scheduled to start on Nimiq’s anniversary, this test is a critical step towards our transition. It’s important to highlight that this test run is exclusive to the community and holds significant importance. It allows our developers to gather data and analyze the migration process from start to finish to ensure its smooth execution. Test of the Migration to Proof-of-Stake As we prepare for the full transition from Testnet Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, we invite our community to participate in this critical testing phase. Depending on your interest and technical expertise, you can join as either a Staker or as a Validator.  General Schedule   Here’s how you can get involved: For Stakers Stakers contribute to the network by locking their tokens to support network operations and security. If you're interested in participating as a Staker, simply follow these steps: Access the Testnet Wallet. Prepare for Pre-Staking: Keep an eye on announcements towards the end of next week when we begin the Pre-Staking phase. During this phase, you can deposit your testNIM and start earning staking rewards. For Validators Validators play a critical role in the network by processing transactions and creating new blocks. If you are looking to engage more deeply in the migration process and have the necessary technical skills, consider registering as a Validator. Review the Documentation: Detailed instructions and requirements for registering as a Validator are available in our Migration Guide. Make sure to go through the guide thoroughly to understand the Validator registration process and responsibilities. Register: During the specified registration period from April 14 to April 17, use the command line tools described in the documentation to complete your registration. By participating as either a Staker or a Validator, you'll play a vital role in testing and securing the Proof-of-Stake migration process. This is not just a test—it's a community effort to pave the way for a sustainable and efficient blockchain infrastructure. We appreciate your active participation and look forward to a smooth and successful migration. Looking Ahead These developments mark a monumental leap toward the migration to Proof-of-Stake. We thank our community for their unwavering support and enthusiasm. Stay tuned to our social channels for upcoming details on the bug bounty program and more updates. Go Nimiq! ]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Team Nimiq would like to introduce their thoughts and suggestions on making adjustments to the coin supply curve for the]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The community has asked for a review of this matter on several occasions. A voiced concern has been that the rate of coin emission for the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) reward is considered too high. It currently stands at the equivalent of ~29% annualized emission rate. Making an adjustment is not a small matter for a decentralized blockchain based cryptocurrency. Given that a PoS switch hard fork is being planned, it is a reasonable time to now actually consider and potentially implement something like this. References to such possibilities were made both in the original whitepaperas well as the contribution terms. Community feedback is welcome and expected as part of the decision making process. The reason we are not using the term “inflation” is because we are looking at the NIM coin supply and ecosystem from the perspective of a currency. In that context, the term “inflation” applies to the “purchasing value of money” which is not simply a matter of the money supply (but instead influenced by multiple factors that also include demand, productivity, etc).  The current supply curve in Nimiq 1.0 PoW was modeled after Bitcoin. The main differences Nimiq implemented were: Moving the comma for how many smallest units (LUNA | SATOSHI) make up the main unit (NIM | BTC). However, the total number of smallest units at final supply stayed the same. The practical idea applied was that the cost of a cup of coffee should settle in at something around 0.01 - 100.00 NIM rather than 0.0000001 - 0.001 BTC.  Replacing halving events with a smooth change of the emission rate. This follows monetary supply economic reasoning in that smaller steady supply changes are preferable to large ones (though some will argue for the marketing value of a halving event). Nimiq’s and Bitcoin’s current coin supply curves, by design, grow very fast in the early years (over 80% of the supply are issued within the first 10 years of the designed 100 year supply emission window). A key difference is timing: Nimiq is much younger and co-exists in a space with hundreds of other coins that weren’t around when Bitcoin went through its years of highest coin supply growth. The current total crypto market cap is distributed among a much larger number of coins. This market cap, especially for the altcoin portion, did not grow proportionally with the number of coins. Thus, the smaller coin supply growth rate that the community is calling for today is a better overall ‘fit’ to match adoption and demand.  When considering modeling a supply curve, there are a lot of degrees of freedom and more or less arbitrary choices to make. That is part of the reason why Nimiq had chosen to take a page out of the Bitcoin playbook and model its supply after Bitcoin’s in the first place. Similarly, when approaching the curve adjustment, it is necessary to reduce complexity through best effort assumptions and boundaries, so the otherwise arbitrary tasks become manageable. After thorough internal consideration and consultations with an independent economic valuation professional, we determined the following assumptions and restrictions for adjusting the curve for Nimiq 2.0 to be: The “coin supply growth” is effectively equal to the “network reward” (or “total reward”) emitted in time (and vice-versa). Such rewards for validators are calculated based on real-world time, not on number of blocks (the percentage of coins staked from total supply does not affect the emission rate). The supply curve still targets to roughly meet/cross a total supply of 21 billion NIM in ~100 years after mainnet launch. This provides an anchorpoint that relates to the original terms of the token generation and the assigned percentages for foundation, charity, contributors, etc based on that supply and time target. Another anchorpoint is the current supply at the time of switching to PoS. Purely for demonstrational purposes, the calculations use April 14 2020 as the time for this switch, as that is a simple two years since mainnet launch. The growth rate should continue to accommodate for the concept that, following the introduction of a currency, the earlier years support higher supply growth than the later years, when some level of saturation has been achieved.  The supply growth should get closer to the generally accepted economic ideal of a monetary system with (positive) smaller, steadier rate changes. Any adjustment should consider the community expectation that the coin supply growth should be smaller than it is now. The initial staking reward (adjusted and non-adjusted) should compare well within the ranges of other current PoS projects of similar maturity, for competitive reasons. The generally accepted theory of monetary supply favors a non-finite coin supply to accommodate continuous economic and user growth. This is further supported by the idea that block rewards should not go to zero. Lastly, some amount of continuous growth helps counteract lost coins over time (although improvements in key management can be expected to reduce this issue). This needs to be considered alongside scarcity as fundamental value driver of crypto which favors limiting the long term growth. Step 1 - Hard Boundaries In the first conclusion we determined two absolute bounds of the supply curve. These establish the area within which any adjusted curve would be positioned:  Boundary "CURRENT" (black dashed): The current Nimiq supply curve based on PoW network reward with approximately ~3300 NIM per minute (April 14, 2020) and a ~12% decrease in the reward rate annually, capped at 21 billion NIM after 98 years. The new supply should stay below this curve, otherwise the growth rate would conflict with assumptions #4, #5 and #6. Once crossing the 98 year anchorpoint, the adjusted supply should move above this curve, otherwise the growth rate would be zero and in conflict with #7. Boundary "Lower" (grey dashed): A linear growth from current NIM supply through 21 billion in 98 years, with approximately ~280 NIM per minute constant network reward. The supply should stay above this line, otherwise the growth rate would conflict with #3. Once crossing the 98 year anchorpoint, the supply should move below this line, otherwise the growth rate would again conflict with #3.   Step 2 - Soft Boundaries In a next step we determined two “soft” bounds that fulfill assumptions #1-#7. Both are based on smaller initial coin growth rates while in return keeping the emission/reward rate higher for longer. We do not introduce additional parameters, variables or dependencies, to keep the model as reasonably simple as possible. Either of those boundaries could also be actual choices for the new supply curve: Suggested Boundary GREEN: The PoS network reward starts at ~900 NIM per minute (April 14 2020) and decreases annually by ~3.15%. Suggested Boundary RED: The PoS network reward starts at ~400 NIM per minute (April 14 2020) and decreases annually by ~0.79%.  A hard cap to the supply may be removed, though looking beyond 100 years is somewhat of a moot discussion. Too much will surely change between now and then with regards to decentralized blockchain and cryptography. Fundamental, evolutionary technology upgrades that could require hard forks need to be taken into account, not only for Nimiq, but also for Bitcoin et al (think about quantum computing). This will provide an opportunity to reevaluate this. While maintaining a solid long-term view, for the purpose of trying to derive a decision, we believe it makes sense to somewhat prioritize the next ~25 years as equivalent to one human generation and the somewhat more “foreseeable” future.  Step 3 - Actual Numbers and Trying it Yourself To further analyze the soft boundaries as new curve options (or option space) we provide the community with the means to simulate and further review the numbers and play with the parameters. The sheet is available for download as Open Document (.ods) and as Excel (.xlsx). The initial rate of coin emission would drop from the current 29% to between 3% - 7%. Assuming for example that 50% of the coin supply is staked, the reward return would be between 6% - 14%. Here is the preview that projects the yearly numbers for annual supply growth, reward and adjusted reward for staking (assuming re-staking) for the red and green curves:  With this we would like to open up the discussion and follow-ups from the community. A useful starting point could be the existing community forum thread that already touched on this topic.  We look forward to constructive comments and feedback on the way to making a decision with the community on potential coin supply adjustments for Nimiq 2.0. We want to hear and discuss all your opinions throughout March and, based on that, share more information regarding the next steps in a future blog post. Stay tuned. Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to a groundbreaking moment in blockchain technology – Nimiq's Zero-Knowledge Proof Setup Ceremony. This ceremony is a huge technical milestone; but also a community-driven effort that invites tech enthusiasts to participate and make their mark in the blockchain world. Check out our latest blog update on Nimiq Proof-of-Stake for an explanation of its structure. If you want to learn more about ZKPs, you can read the series of blog posts we wrote on this topic: Intro to Zero Knowledge Proofs Part 1 and Part 2. In this post, we'll dive deeper into the upcoming Zero-Knowledge Proof Setup Ceremony. This cutting-edge cryptographic process is crucial for the secure and trustless creation of proving and verifying keys, which will be used in Nimiq Proof-of-Stake for generating ZKP Proofs. Let’s start by exploring how this technology acts as a fundamental building block of the Blockchain. Recursive Zero-Knowledge Proofs To understand how recursive ZKPs function within the blockchain, imagine a series of proofs where each new one validates the previous, creating an unbroken chain of verification. This "recursive" approach significantly reduces the time and computational resources required for syncing and leverages the constant proof size to decrease the growth of Blockchain data in comparison to a UTXO-based chain. Prover nodes, vital in this system, generate these proofs using specific proving keys. Nodes participating in the Nimiq network then use the corresponding verifying keys to verify these proofs, all without needing to access any other data, hence the term "zero-knowledge". Introduction to the ZKP Ceremony Zero-knowledge proof verification ensures a smooth and efficient syncing process for users. However, as we've mentioned earlier, the foundation of this verification process lies in the proving and verifying keys. To generate these keys in a decentralized manner, a setup ceremony is essential. This ceremony helps to diminish the element of trust among multiple participants. As the Nimiq Blockchain developers orchestrate this ceremony, contributors will play a pivotal role. You'll begin by incorporating a random value as input to generate a key pair and a fragment of random data. This data, known as 'toxic waste,' must be discarded to ensure the integrity of the final proof. The beauty of this process lies in its collaborative nature. The more contributors there are, the more widely the toxic waste is distributed. This distribution is crucial because it reduces the risk of generating unsound or false proofs. If a single entity were to control all the toxic waste, the system's integrity could be compromised. However, widespread participation ensures the proofs' integrity and security. As long as a single participant is honest and destroys their toxic waste, the system’s integrity is preserved. How to Participate The first step is to generate the key pair required to participate in the ceremony, the instructions to do so can be found here. After generating the key pair, the ceremony will unfold in two phases. Participants can join either one or both rounds, but we encourage our users to participate in both! It’s worth noting that the outcome of Phase 1 is not only beneficial for Nimiq, but is designed to be reusable in other projects, contributing to advancements in the crypto space. Phase 1 holds significance for the entire community, while Phase 2 exclusively supports Nimiq. Team Nimiq will guide contributors through every step of the setup process. Sign-up using this form, and stay tuned for updates! We're planning to launch the ceremony in the coming weeks and are currently focused on maximizing participation. We encourage the Nimiq Community to invite their tech-savvy friends. Even those new to crypto are welcome! As the start date draws closer, we'll share more details about the ceremony.  Join us on this monumental journey as we pave the way for a more efficient, secure, and inclusive blockchain future. Your participation in the Zero Knowledge Proof Setup Ceremony is more than a contribution; it’s a testament to the power of community-driven innovation in the blockchain space.  Pura Vida,
Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Plans for the Nimiq 2.0 hard fork process]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[As you all already know, Nimiq 1.0 is going to transition to Nimiq 2.0 in the near future. With this major update the Nimiq blockchain will move from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake with a new, high-performance consensus algorithm as well as the new, recently elected NIM supply curve. The switch to Nimiq 2.0 will happen through a “hard fork” and in this blog post we will share our plans for the entire process leading up to and including the hard fork. Since Nimiq 2.0 will have a completely different consensus algorithm than Nimiq 1.0, the only way to transition is to stop the Nimiq 1.0 blockchain and then start the Nimiq 2.0 blockchain. To do this we will need to introduce a soft fork in Nimiq 1.0, get validators for Nimiq 2.0 and finally create a genesis block to start the Nimiq 2.0 blockchain as described in the following sections in more detail. Nimiq 1.0 Soft Fork  The first step will be to do a soft fork on Nimiq 1.0. The main purpose of this soft fork is to give us the ability to stop the Nimiq 1.0 blockchain later when we need to. We prefer a miner-activated soft fork, rather than an user-activated soft fork because the community has already signaled their approval, plus, a miner-activated soft fork is much simpler to realize. So, after we release the new client with the soft fork, miners signal that they installed the new client by writing some data to the “extra data” field of the block body for all blocks that they mine. We can estimate the percentage of the hashpower that installed the new version by, for example, seeing how many of the last 1000 blocks have the signal. When that percentage reaches a predetermined threshold, the fork is activated. This must not be interpreted as a vote by the miners as the decision to switch to Nimiq 2.0 was already made by the overwhelming majority of the community. Instead, miners are simply signalling their readiness for the soft fork. After the soft fork is activated, nothing will change initially, the blockchain will continue as normal. The main difference is the miners will now be able to receive a signal from Team Nimiq and when that signal happens all miners that installed the new client will stop mining — more details on this follow in the next sections. Of course we can’t force every miner to install the new client and the miners that do not install it will continue to produce blocks even after everyone else stopped. Until the hard fork date, we will not know if anyone will bother to continue and support the old protocol. But with the community, the team and the exchanges committed to upgrading to Nimiq 2.0, we can be certain that there is no reasonable incentive to pursue the expired blockchain.. Validators for Nimiq 2.0  To get the 2.0 blockchain started, the genesis block (see below) will be signed by a set of validators controlled by the team. But from that point on, we want to have validators from the community. For that to be possible, the genesis block must already contain a list of potential validators, i.e. people who staked funds and are willing to produce blocks. So we will need to let people become validators before the Nimiq 2.0 blockchain even starts. For some time, between the introduction of the soft fork on Nimiq 1.0 and the hard fork date, any NIM holder will be able to signal their intention to become the first validators on the Nimiq 2.0 blockchain. This will be very similar to how the supply curve voting occurred, by sending a simple transaction of 1 Luna (0.00001 NIM) to a predetermined address.  But anyone that wishes to be one of the first validators on Nimiq 2.0 will need to meet some more conditions. Some of these are necessary because of the protocol itself — for example, staking a minimum of 10’000 NIM and submitting the validator public key — while others will be imposed by us to guarantee that all the validators will be online and ready when the Nimiq 2.0 blockchain starts — for example, running a validator node on the Testnet for a long enough time. The exact set of conditions hasn’t been decided yet but will be shared with the community on time. The fortunate people who are able to pass this screening process will be included in the genesis block and will become the first validators of Nimiq 2.0, thus making history! We want to emphasize that the more centralized and restrictive process only applies to the validators of that very first epoch. Anyone that wants to validate on Nimiq 2.0, but does not wish to go through this process, can simply wait for Nimiq 2.0 to start and stake their funds then. The validators from the second epoch forward will be chosen entirely by the protocol and without any intervention from Team Nimiq whatsoever. Note: the above mentioned 10’000 NIM applies to stakers that run their own validator only, there will be no predetermined minimum for delegated staking, but a staking pool owner might choose to set one.  Nimiq 2.0 Genesis After we introduce the soft fork to Nimiq 1.0 and select validators for Nimiq 2.0 we are ready to start the hard fork. The hard fork will happen in three phases. Phase 1  There will be a signal on the Nimiq 1.0 blockchain. This signal will simply be a transaction sent from an address controlled by Team Nimiq that was hard-coded into the soft fork. When this transaction is mined, a countdown will begin. When the countdown ends, phase two will begin. The purpose of phase one is to allow time for any last preparations before the blockchain upgrades. The length of the countdown isn’t set in stone yet, but will likely be between one and two weeks. Phase 2  When phase two begins, all transactions will be forbidden. No more transactions of any kind will be allowed (with the exception of the block reward). In effect this will freeze everyone’s funds. Then a second countdown will begin, but this one will be much shorter, somewhere between 20 and 30 minutes. The purpose of phase two is to finalize the state of the Nimiq 1.0 blockchain. Since Proof-of-Work has probabilistic finality we need to wait for several blocks until we are certain that a given block won’t be reversed. And we need to know with certainty what the state of the 1.0 blockchain is so that we can transfer it to the upgraded 2.0 blockchain. When the countdown ends, phase three will begin. Phase 3  Miners will stop producing blocks thereby effectively halting the Nimiq 1.0 blockchain. At the same time, Team Nimiq will take the last block produced and snapshot the state — the one which was already frozen many blocks before. This snapshot will be used, with the help of an automated tool that we will create and open-source beforehand, to create the genesis block for the Nimiq 2.0 blockchain. The genesis block will then be broadcast to the network and received by the validators who were selected to be the first validators of Nimiq 2.0. These validators will then start producing blocks and Nimiq 2.0 will be born! Team Nimiq is very excited and working hard towards this goal.

            <description><![CDATA[We redesigned the Nimiq user experience with a bold aspiration: Create the easiest, most convenient and most accessible ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The latest update introduces a variety of improvements and features for new and existing users alike. However, it is only the tip of the iceberg. The current implementation remains a mix of old and new design language. The Safe, Nimiq’s browser-wallet, was updated but the actual new Safe is yet to be implemented — including features such as Cashlinks and donations. That being said, we are thrilled to present the massive improvements and some of the reasoning behind them. Before we get started. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency are complicated matters. Understanding them requires a significant amount of involvement, time and — to some extent — capability. Using them as well. Eradicating these barriers, and empowering wider adoption by doing so, is and was what defines Nimiq. This mantra influences all design decisions and was now consequently applied to the product. We stopped thinking inside the blockchain box and came to the realization that we are not “just” competing over the best crypto, we are competing over the best payment system in general. To do so, Nimiq needs to provide accessible and applicable value to users that is superior to existing solutions. Additionally, we started to implement a more professional approach to acquisition funnels, user-journeys and conversion tracking to ensure steady iterations, improvements and ultimately, growth. Designing for radical simplicity. While the biggest leaps in terms of usability are unarguably achieved through technological advancements and translating complicated technicalities into relatable concepts, we needed new interfaces that are capable of actually leveraging that for users. Additionally, the new interface design had to live up to our high goal of radical simplicity while keeping the heart of our brand. We stripped away everything that wasn’t absolutely necessary for the interface to function. By reducing the number of elements and info on each screen we achieved a focus on the important elements. Additionally, we dedicated every step in a user-flow to exactly one action, ensuring additional focus. We went from an intensely colored design language to a simple and plain one that works with a lot of whitespace and shades of gray, which gave us the possibility to make our sparingly used brand colors really stand out to guide users through our flows. We aim for interfaces that are so simple and basic that they can be understood as a boilerplate for the community to build their own apps upon, but still maintain a different look and feel — and are nonetheless actually fun to use. Easy money. Many of the crypto-specific concepts and terms are unknown to most and especially hard to get for non-technical people. So for Nimiq, we avoid crypto slang and use established concepts where possible, reducing the cognitive load to a minimum.  Accounts While the word ‘account’ has a common meaning when it comes to banking and finance, our accounts are rather to be compared with the representations of identity in web-services (e.g. a Google account). Accounts manage and aggregate addresses but cannot send or receive funds on their own. They are visually represented by a ring of hexagons which hints at which and how many addresses it contains.  Addresses A Nimiq Address is a simplified public key that looks like a regular IBAN address. Addresses hold, send and receive NIM. Accounts manage addresses — addresses can send and receive funds. The Nimiq Addresses are represented by fun looking avatars, so-called Identicons. The visual appearance of those avatars is directly derived from the address they represent, thus making the avatars a human-readable way to display and verify a cryptocurrency address. To give the most relevant example: Sending crypto requires diligence to avoid making a potentially dramatic mistake while typing or pasting the receiver’s address. An avatar, in contrast, can be checked and verified at a glance. On top of this, the avatars add a fun and relatable touch to what would otherwise be a rather dry and technocratic matter, read more on the Identicons here. Auto-naming for new Accounts and Addresses To support the visuals, an automated naming concept was implemented that provides relatable names for newly created accounts and addresses. Of course, these names can be changed at all times.  An account is named after the background color of its initial address. It is rather a basic concept that can eventually result in a user having two ‘Yellow Accounts’. Still, we are happy to avoid generic ‘New Accounts’ and provide some guidance here. The address names, however, are directly derived from and correspond to the avatar’s appearance (and thus, from the actual address). If your Avatar has roller skates, glasses and a cowboy hat, it might be called the ‘Reading Outdoor Skater’ or the ‘Inline Cattle-Driving Geek’ or the ‘Rolling Nerdy Cowboy’ The visuals and names result in about 4 billion unique combinations. Super easy entry The gateway into the Nimiq ecosystem is the most crucial point of a user’s journey. We took our time to create an entry to the Nimiq blockchain that has one clear cut goal: Be easy.  The radically simplified account creation consists of only two steps: Choosing an avatar and setting a password. And just like that, the user becomes a first-class citizen of the Nimiq Blockchain. We believe it to be the easiest and fastest onboarding for any payment system, crypto or conventional. Our estimated account creation time is way below 30 seconds — give it a try and let us know how you liked it. However, Nimiq is a decentralized payment system and as such, it can’t be secure enough. As security and convenience often oppose each other when it comes to user-experience we had to find a solid middle ground. The basic idea here is: Security should correspond to the user’s situation. A new user should be enabled to try Nimiq before having to commit time and effort to it. Therefore, we chopped the onboarding into three easily digestible concepts with the most inconvenient one being a somewhat optional choice that we encourage but don’t enforce. Step 1. Account and password creation The password is set at account creation and is mandatory. It is required to transact NIM, to download the Login File, to back up the Recovery Words and to add more addresses to an account. Password: To authorize important actions Step 2. Login File download  After a new user has created an account, she/he is presented with a prominent call-to-action to download the ‘Login File’, right at the top of the dashboard. The Login File is Nimiq’s version of the ImageWallet standard (co-developed by Nimiq). It is the default way of logging in to Nimiq. As an image file, it can be easily moved and stored. In the near future, a device’s camera can be used to conveniently log in to the account via the featured QR code. The Login File is encrypted with the account’s password. Login File + Password: The way to log in to your account  Step 3. Recovery Words backup  After the Login File was successfully downloaded, a new call-to-action appears. The user is now considerably involved in Nimiq as she/he has already successfully completed the onboarding steps and can now be presented with the most inconvenient step: writing down the 24 Recovery Words. Again, the name is intended to be self-explanatory. Recovery Words: The backup of your account Both Login File and Recovery Words come with short but informative advice on the security implications and on how to best handle these presumably unknown concepts of crypto-security. Super fast payments: The Nimiq Shop-Checkout  Paying with NIM is now as easy as paying with PayPal. The all-new online-checkout flow allows for super quick and convenient payments. When shopping online with NIM, simply click pay, choose an address and confirm the transaction with your password. The interface is reduced to the minimum and aims to deliver a light and enjoyable experience that provides high reliability and control nonetheless. Logout With this release of our new apps, you are now able to log out of your account(s) with a simple click of a button. Logging out removes all settings associated with that account from your device, so be sure to make use of the backup options Nimiq presents before you hit the final logout-confirm button. What’s next? The list of features and ideas, from implementation-ready designs to vague concepts, is long. The concept of a browser-based blockchain opens up a whole world of potential use cases and apps that hold the power to outperform existing solutions — fiat based services as well as more conventional blockchain solutions. The fast and easy user experience of Nimiq is not due to some magically well-done design work, it’s the accessibility and the easiness of the browser-first Nimiq blockchain that empowers it. Stay tuned for an article about the next features to come (yes, Cashlinks is one of them). How do you like the new UX? How do you like the design? Create an account and provide some feedback and support Nimiq to build the future of money.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Don’t buy crypto, earn it! The easiest way for freelancers, influencers, owners of small businesses and rental experienc]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[With 35% of the US workforce working as freelancers and the global gig economy ballooning to over $4.5 trillion per year, the chances are that you either are or know people who have embraced this increasingly popular way of working. On top of this, there are also 582 million entrepreneurs in the world, with most of them running small businesses. If you work as a freelancer, artist, own a small business or rent a vacation retreat and are open to the idea of widening your client base (or just want a stake in crypto’s future), then we have an easy solution to get you started on your crypto journey. What is Cryptopayment.link?  In a nutshell, we feel Cryptopayment.link is the world’s simplest crypto payment request and payment monitoring tool. It’s been built by Team Nimiq to make it easy for people to earn crypto--instead of buying it--by selling their service, product or other offering!  Cryptopayment.link does this by making it quick and easy to create/send Bitcoin, Ethereum and NIM payment requests to your client via a single unique link, whilst automating the amount quoted to the client in crypto to match the amount you enter in USD/Euro. The solution also offers a handy blockchain monitoring tool that sends you an email notification as soon as you have been paid.  What’s even better is that Cryptopayment.link does all this with no annoying installations or plugins. This completely free service offered by Nimiq is also entirely non-custodial, which means that payments are made directly from a client’s crypto wallet to yours without the use of a middleman (who usually charges fees). Cryptopayment.link also helps by pointing crypto newcomers in the right direction to create a Bitcoin, Ethereum or NIM wallet and saves your crypto payment addresses within your web browser to quickly initiate new payment requests. When To Use Cryptopayment.link This simple tool allows newcomers to crypto to easily accumulate their first bit of crypto, become stakeholders in the wider ecosystem and experience the advantages of holding cryptocurrency. By selling a good or service using this tool, you can bypass the obstacles of buying crypto on an exchange (with the need to submit personal information, connect bank accounts, etc). This tool does not intend to entirely replace how you receive your income, but by supplementing even 1 in 20 payments in crypto, you gain the advantages of diversifying your assets. Some examples of businesses this tool would be ideal for: Vacation rentals, retreats or experience packages Classes or instructions Artwork, commission work, photography, videography Freelance work in general (coding, content writing, marketing, development, design, data entry, accountancy services, etc) A shift in working patterns can be seen in the astonishing revenue growth of freelance platforms like UpWork, which is a marketplace that matches freelancers with business owners and recently reported annual revenues of over $1.7 billion. The potential to save on fees is especially relevant when serving international clients. The cost to process an international bank transfer can be as high as $50. PayPal email invoicing costs 2.9% + a small additional flat fee for every transaction. As any freelancer or individual business owner will tell you, someone ultimately ends up paying these fees and ends up with less money in their pocket. Though crypto prices can fluctuate, this can be offset by the relatively low crypto transaction costs (below 40 cents and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can typically be converted to local currency at a cost of 1% or less). If the person receiving payment in crypto wants to minimise the short-term volatility risk, their option is to convert their crypto into local currency quickly after receiving it.   Many freelancers, individual business owners, and influencers already have a solid knowledge of the standard tools used to operate internationally. It is likely they have also heard about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and how the innovative tech emerging from this space could be groundbreaking. What the Cryptopayment.link tool offers is an easy way to get some skin in the cryptocurrency markets. If crypto has the bright future we all believe it has, then this could turn out to be a very wise choice indeed. Finally, there are some counterparties that look for opportunities to make payments in crypto just because they already have a solid stake, want to support the system or again want to save on the cost of transaction. Not accepting crypto as a payment method carries the risk of effectively shutting the door on these potential clients. Cryptopayment.link offers an easy way to expand your potential client base by making it easy to accept and track crypto payments. Cryptopayment.link & Zopilote: The First Steps To Real-World Adoption  Zopilote is a surf camp on the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica. The owner of the business believes that crypto could be a big thing in the future and wanted an easy way to accumulate some crypto in exchange for his surf camp retreats. Naturally, Team Nimiq went out to Zopilote to talk to them and show them how Cryptopayment.link could be the tool they were looking for. By the end of the meeting, they had learned how to use Cryptopayment.link and were excited to use the tool for Zopilote vacation packages and rentals. We’d like to thank Zopilote for the insightful feedback given in the meeting and making Zopilote the first real-world adopter of Cryptopayment.link. How To Get Started? If you are open to accepting your first crypto payment with Cryptopayment.link, all you need to do is to simply add a payment note and enter the amount of USD or Euros you want to charge your client.   Next, just enter your brand name and email address to enable Cryptopayment.link to send an email notification to you once your client has paid. This is made possible by Cryptopayment.link monitoring the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Nimiq blockchains for you. Share your Cryptopayment.link with your counterparty via email, chat or messenger and once the service spots that your crypto payment has been confirmed on the respective blockchain, you (as well as the paying counterparty) will get a payment confirmation email.   And for all you crypto veterans out there, you’ll know how much of a hassle and distraction it can be to keep checking if a payment has been received. Cryptopayment.link takes care of all that for you, so you can focus more time on your business and keeping clients happy. Now, you’ll be asked to enter your Bitcoin, Ethereum or NIM address if you have one or you can click the question mark icon next to the cryptocurrency you want to use and be taken to Cryptopayment.link’s recommended wallet for that crypto.  The smart thing about Cryptopayment.link is that, because it’s browser-based, the cryptocurrency addresses will be saved within your browser for you. That means that it’s a whole lot quicker to send crypto payment requests the second time around.  Finally, click ‘create link’ and you’ll then see a crypto payment link that you can send to your client using email or messaging apps like Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook Messenger.  Alternatively, you can insert crypto payment links into invoices using popular accounting software like Xero. What Happens After You Have Generated A Payment Link? For starters, you’ll get a confirmation email telling you that your payment link has been successfully created. Once your client has paid your crypto payment link, you’ll then get a handy email notification telling you that you’ve been paid.   Crypto Made Easy Nimiq has always had the objective of making crypto easy. Team Nimiq believes it has identified a massive potential market of people for whom accumulating their first crypto is beginning to make sense. It can be challenging to set up exchange accounts, jump through KYC hoops and connect a bank account just to buy your first crypto. Setting up crypto wallets, making a payment request in Crypto, invoicing the correct amount and monitoring if the payment has been made, can also be overwhelming. Cryptopayment.link solves these pain points whilst also featuring NIM prominently to help raise awareness about Nimiq, which can then be leveraged to help cross-sell users to NIM in the future. According to the stats, chances are that you know a small business owner or freelancer. Maybe even some who have an interest in crypto and want to diversify by accepting it! We would encourage you to share this service with anyone you think could benefit from it. We’d greatly appreciate any feedback and you doing your bit for crypto adoption 😉! We hope you are as excited as we are for 2020. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how to participate in the Nimiq 2.0 Supply Curve Voting Procedure]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The decision on changing the supply curve of Nimiq is a fundamental and far reaching one. We are convinced that it is important to provide the wide range of Nimiq Stakeholders with the opportunity to be part of this process, including everyone from earliest contributors to new supporters that just discovered Nimiq. Over several months now, Team Nimiq has been working on finding and implementing a democratic, secure, and educated way to making the decision regarding the potential change of Nimiq’s Supply Curve. In a nutshell this concerns lowering the current coin supply growth rate ("inflation") by varying degrees and its shorter and longer-term considerations. [UPDATE 2: The follow-up ranking vote concluded on June 8, 2020 and the NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0 has been determined as the "BLUE" curve (community suggestion). See results here.] [UPDATE 1: First vote concluded May 18, 2020 with "YES" on making an adjustment to the NIM supply curve. See results here.] The story so far The steps taken by Nimiq to arrive at this decision making junction: Research since Q4 2019 regarding the topic and publishing of a detailed article early March 2020 with findings and considerations. Discussing these considerations with the Nimiq Community in the respective forums and social media. Hosting an AMA with the community to conclude such discussions in an active and engaging way. Adding a curve option suggested by the community. Defining a process which will allow supporters to vote using their NIM balance and storing this data publicly in the Nimiq Blockchain. Building an open source voting app for this process. Publishing a blog post in April with additional information on the expanded curve options, and the decision finding process. Testing the voting app with the community, processing feedback and auditing the tool to get it production ready. The next steps The next steps (excluding a preceding test voting round) are detailed in this image which was first presented in a previous blog post.   Here a more detailed description of what to expect: Testing (https://nimiq-testnet.com/vote): In order to get started, a test voting round will take place from Saturday May 2 to Wednesday May 6 a new test voting round will take place from Saturday May 23 to Tuesday May 26. This way, stakeholders will have a chance to get familiar with the app before the actual vote. Test voting uses the Testnet, so DO NOT USE your Mainnet account(s). First Vote (https://nimiq.com/vote#change-curve): Should Nimiq adjust the current supply curve? Stakeholders can vote “Yes” or “No” for 10 days: starting on Friday May 8, 2020 at approximately 12:00 noon UTC and ending on Monday May 18 at approximately 12:00 noon UTC (the more exact time will be determined by a specific blockheight target published at the beginning of the vote). [UPDATE: Vote concluded May 18, 2020 with"YES" on making an adjustment to the NIM supply curve. See results here.] Second Vote (https://nimiq.com/vote#rank-curves): Given that the first decision resulted in favor of a supply curve adjustment, stakeholders can vote by ranking four options: “Green Curve”, “Red Curve”, “Blue Curve” or “None of these” (1st choice = 1pt, 2nd = 1/2pt, 3rd = 1/4pt, 4th = 1/8pt). This vote will be open for 10 days, starting on Friday May 29, 2020 at approximately 12:00 noon UTC and ending on Monday June 8 at approximately 12:00 noon UTC (the more exact time would be determined by a specific blockheight target published at the beginning of the vote). [UPDATE: Vote concluded on June 8, 2020 and the NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0 has been determined as the "BLUE" curve (community suggestion). See results here.] You can read more about every curve in this dedicated blog post. In case the second vote outcome concludes that a majority of stakeholders prefer an adjustment different from the curves offered (meaning, “None of them”), the community will have 14 days to come up with a better suggestion. In this case a third vote would be scheduled to decide on accepting or rejecting the new supply curve alternative. It is important to note that if there is no alternative provided by the community, or this third vote ends with a rejection, the task for a final decision will fall back on the shoulders of Team Nimiq, to secure moving forward. IMPORTANT:  You can NOT vote with funds held in exchanges or third party wallets,because they don’t support custom public messages in transactions, which are needed for the vote to be recorded on the blockchain. You can also not vote with funds in vesting contracts (please move available funds to a regular account address first). Your vote will be submitted through the Nimiq Voting app by sending 1 Luna (= 0.00001 NIM) to the preset burn address (an address that will be calculated by the voting app based on the hash of the voting setup. This makes it verifiable that the setup is not changed during or after voting). The transaction contains the vote in form of a public message recorded on the blockchain. What counts is the balance (1 NIM = 1 Vote) on your voting address AT THE CLOSING OF THE VOTE WHEN A SNAPSHOT OF THE BLOCKCHAIN IS TAKEN AT THE FINAL BLOCK. Example: if you submit a vote and then move the funds away from that address before the end of the voting period, the balance on that address will be zero, equivalent to no votes. Note that of course you can vote again with your new address that now has the balance. This prevents anyone from using their balance(s) more than once. You can change your vote by voting again with the same address.Only the last vote of an address counts, at the end of the voting period, with the balance it has at that time. Do not wait until the last minute to submit your vote. Things always take longer than expected and this way you can also correct your vote in case you made a mistake or changed your mind by re-submitting your vote. Please follow our social media for announcements of any unexpected changes to this timeline. Using the Voting App The first vote has been concluded. The second vote will be on the Mainnet at https://nimiq.com/vote#rank-curves. The voting app is available on the Testnet at https://nimiq-testnet.com/vote for you to try out. Click here for free Testnet NIM. Reminder: DO NOT USE your Mainnet account(s) on the Testnet. Guide for first vote [YES/NO, May 8 - 18] Step 1: Read the instructions carefully  Step 2: Select your preferred option Choose the option you would like to vote for. The “VOTE” button will be enabled when you do so.  Step 3: Select your address By clicking the VOTE button, the familiar Nimiq Checkout dialog will appear. If you have multiple addresses, you will be asked to select one.  Step 4: Submit your Vote After selecting your address, you will be prompted for your password. If you are voting with an address stored on a Ledger hardware wallet, connect your Ledger and confirm the transaction in the Ledger Nimiq app. After you confirm, the transaction will be processed and your vote recorded on the Nimiq Blockchain.  Step 5: See the Results After your vote has been submitted, you will be able to see the preliminary results. Note that your vote will take a few minutes to be recorded on the blockchain and enter the calculations. You can still vote again if you change your mind. Also you can vote with every address that has a balance to maximize your vote (instead of moving all your NIM to a single address to vote from). Only the address balances at the end of the voting period count towards the vote. In other words, for your voting balance to count, do not move your funds before the end of the vote.  Guide for second vote [Rank, May 29 - June 8] Step 1: Read the instructions carefully Your ranked choices will be counted according to a normalized geometric progression (see info icon top right). That means the 1st choice gets 1 point, the 2nd 1/2 points, 3rd 1/4 points and 4th 1/8 points. Next, the point values are normalized to a total of 1 and the resulting factor will be multiplied with the NIM in your vote. This way, each NIM represents exactly one vote distributed over your choices.  Step 2: Rank the choices The curve choices are randomized in their position when you enter the voting app. Drag them into the order of your preference before submitting your vote. You can read more about the curves in this Blog as well as this forum discussion.  Step 3: Submit your vote When you have finalized your ranking, click “Vote” and follow the same instructions detailed above in the guide for first vote from “Step 4”. What’s Next? Try out our Testnet Vote which will run until Wednesday May 6. The important first vote on Mainnet will begin on Friday May 8 approximately at 12:00 noon UTC. UPDATE: The important first vote on Mainnet has been concluded and resulted with 78.4% in favor of making an adjustment to the NIM supply curve. The second vote on ranking NIM supply curve options will begin on Friday May 29 at approximately 12:00 noon UTC (https://nimiq.com/vote#rank-curves). Try the Testnet Ranking Vote from Saturday May 23 to Tuesday May 26. Nimiq will share all official information and results on its Twitter account so make sure to stay tuned. [UPDATE: The voting process concluded on June 8, 2020 and the NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0 has been determined as the "BLUE" curve (community suggestion)] As always, we would like to thank everyone for their support and participation in this important decision on the path forward.  Pura Vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Proposals, Awards and Elections]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to another update of the Nimiq Community Board. This month we had a very active discussion about things to come. Let’s get right to it!  Community Proposals  Nimiq Gold Our first proposal to discuss was Nimiq Gold, a staking pool planned for Nimiq 2.0. The Board discussed several aspects of the project: This project is a for profit project. The source code is not planned to be open sourced, reducing the value for the community as well as the pool's security due to the lack of peer reviews by fellow community developers. The requested amount of 2 Million NIM seems rather big compared to the size of previous projects that can be considered more challenging work. Community developers are already working on pool implementations questioning this closed source effort in general. The board decided to reject the proposal as it is currently presented and wait for a stable Nimiq 2.0 Testnet to analyze again how many community developers created pool implementations already. Maybe by a later point it will make sense to create a bounty for an open sourced pool implementation.  Nimiq Japan This proposal was posted to the Nimiq Forum. To quote:  “The goal is to deliver the Nimiq news in the Japanese language especially for those who don’t have English as their best language and eventually translate the website itself.” A seed node is also proposed to be managed, which would help to further strengthen the Nimiq Network. The proposal makes a lot of sense given that Japan is a country with a growing community, but no seed nodes close by yet, and not a lot of members speaking English. As other, similar projects exist, such as Nimiq China, the board discussed which countries or areas of the world would be available for these types of proposals. The amount of users, the distance from current users and the language barrier justifies this case and those variables should be taken in consideration moving forward. Furthermore we discussed the need for an incentive structure for seed nodes since currently they are hosted and managed out of pure love for the Nimiq project and giving support makes sense. This effort will be done together with members of Nimiq’s Blockchain Team and future decisions will be made public on Nimiq's website and social media channels.  Nimiq Advertisement Wallet This proposal was sent by mail and we added it to the forum for transparency. We discussed the proposed roadmap and the overall large scale of the project and the challenges projects with lots of features present. The board would require from the project owner to provide a timeline with deliverables which are then rewarded upon completion. During the discussions, the project owner shifted his mindset and decided to morph the project by changing the focus, adding different features and integrating more coins at the same time.  Thus, the conclusion is to reject the proposal and to keep our eyes open for an opportunity of integrating Nimiq into this new project as it unfolds. We are in touch with the project manager and will follow their progress closely. Most Valuable Nimion Award It is time for the new most Valuable Nimion Award! This month we discussed   Mr Satoshi’s ideas Lately Mr Satoshi has been sharing ideas of different entities that Nimiq could partner with. Even though none of the partnerships has yielded results yes, we appreciate this effort and reward his proactive behavior with 4'000 NIM.  Seb’s videos Community member Seb has created a couple of videos that catched everybody’s attention. His creativity has impressed us and we would like to give him 10’000 NIM as a token of our appreciation.  Francis’ active support Everybody who is part of the community in Telegram knows Francis and is aware of him actively supporting other community members. He is always keen to help and eager to provide a positive contribution to discussions. Thanks a lot Francis! We would like to reward you with 4’000 NIM!  Community Board Elections The time has come to transition to a new board and we would like to invite all community members who are interested in participating to share a short bio in the forum. Next, we’ll share them publicly for everybody to discuss. We will be using the Nimiq Voting App to select the new board and plan to have a transition meeting the next time we get together. Until the next one, Nimiq Community Funding Board]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq Awards, Nimiq Community Infrastructure and Hackathon]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Every month the Community Funding Board holds a meeting and discusses ways to increase and facilitate engagement and development of the Nimiq Community. The June meeting was held recently and here are the details. Nimiq Community Infrastructure Since the conception of the Community Funding Board, a recurrent request has been made: Hosting Infrastructure. Given that during this term two of the community representatives are experienced system administrators, this topic has been discussed in the previous meeting and a task force was created.  The task force includes system administrators from Team Nimiq and the Nimiq Community. From Team Nimiq, Jeff, Curd and Richy will be supporting this effort. From the community side Maestro, Vasconcelos, Redmaner and Steffan took a step forward to help.  During this meeting Maestro and Vasconcelos shared an update of the work being done so far. A first meeting of the Nimiq Web Services Task Force was already held and this were the topics discussed: Regular Meetings & Communication: The task force created communication channels to keep synced. A regular meetings are scheduled and the members agreed that it makes sense to hold ad-hoc meetings for urgent matters. Hosting Provider: After some research, the task force decided to consider https://evolution-host.com/ as one of the potential providers. Members of the task force will research and test services so a decision can be made in the following weeks. Initial Research: The forum will be used to start collect ideas and list resources currently used by community projects. This way the Nimiq Community Infrastructure Task Force can gather an initial set of projects for a testing phase. Guidelines: The initial testing phase will help to define specific guidelines. For now the task force has discussed two main concerns: Start with trial period: A trial period will support early projects, which could jumpstart cool new projects that might have never happened otherwise. If a project gets too big, or gets commercial it needs to host its own infrastructure. An option might be added in the future to pay with Nimiq to use the infrastructure. We would like to actively request all interested community devs to share their active projects and ideas in order for the task force to collect relevant data and move forward. Please do so in the Project Ideas section of the forum. Nimiq Community Member Awards As every month, the community representatives give awards to the most active and helpful users. This month’s awards go to: Nimtris  With so many people trying out Nimtris it comes to no surprise that the Community Board wants to support the effort. Last month the developer behind Nimtris was rewarded already for his work and this month the board agreed to donate 25’000 NIM to Nimtris' account directly. This way we ensure the app has enough funds for the community to keep using it and to bring new users into the Nimiq Ecosystem. Francis, Sandman and Rob for Community Support  Community Board noticed that this month three users have been helping new users and also spread the word of Nimiq with nice informative posts. We appreciate and want to encourage this behaviour so 10’000 NIM have been rewarded to each of them. Harley and Paul for Miqslist  This cool new app developed by Paul (Nimiq Video Game store) and Harley (Nim4) is aiming at helping users to find places where they can use Nimiq. They also have been making quite some noise in their Twitter account, which we love and want to support. Of course, this amazing contribution to the community had to be rewarded and the board agreed to give both Paul and Harley 25’000 NIM each for their impressive effort. Keep it going guys!  Nimiq Community Hackathon This last month the developer community eagerly welcomed the Albatross Testnet. However, proposals are still to be received and the Community Board discussed ways to engage developers. This is how the idea of a first community hackathon was born.  The format discussed so far is the following: A weekend hackathon will be scheduled for developers. Groups of up to three developers can collaborate. The Community Funding Board will sponsor the hackathon prizes together with the Nimiq Foundation. The hackathon is expected to start on a Friday at midnight UTC and finish three days later on Sunday at midnight UTC. The board will collect feedback both from the community and from developers of Team Nimiq during the following week and then, based on it, decide on the winners. The community can propose ideas of projects for which prototypes can be built within a weekend by up to three people. The project can of course be improved over time but an MVP has to be delivered by the end of the hackathon. Community members are encouraged to share ideas using this templatein the Project Ideas section of the forum. We want the entire community to be able to participate in the hackathon whether they are developers or not. Designers, communication managers and project managers are welcome. You can suggest ideas and/or post your skills in the specific post for the hackathon. We hope to have specific ideas for projects and more concrete plans for the hackathon ready for next month, so stay tuned! Thank you for your support. Things are picking up speed and it is our desire as Community Board to do everything in our hands to support the thriving Nimiq Community.  Until next month, Nimiq Community Board]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[You can now hold Bitcoin BTC and swap back and forth with NIM using non-custodial atomic swaps!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Bitcoin Support  You can now add Bitcoin to your Nimiq accounts, including the ones on your Ledger hardware wallet! When you open the wallet for the next time after this update, you will get a popup asking you to activate Bitcoin. If you later on create a new account or log in with an existing account, Bitcoin support will automatically be enabled for you.  Your Bitcoins are secured with the same Login File, recovery words and password as your NIM! Here's what it looks like:   Here you see the NIM and BTC balance of your active account. The bars are colored like the background of your identicons and the size represents the distribution of your funds in NIM and BTC. By clicking on the button in the middle, you can do atomic swaps between NIM and BTC. Click on the Bitcoin section down here to see your BTC transaction history.  You can generate new Bitcoin addresses to receive BTC with the "Receive" button and send BTC to any address with the "Send" button.  This is your BTC transaction history for this account.  Since Bitcoin has a different approach towards reusing account addresses than Nimiq, each account in the Nimiq Wallet shows one aggregate Bitcoin balance summarizing all used addresses. Everytime you send or receive Bitcoin, a new address is generated, avoiding address reuse — a best practice in Bitcoin. This mainly has privacy reasons and is due to the UTXO system used in Bitcoin, while Nimiq uses an account system similar to Ethereum. To connect and sync with the Bitcoin network, the Nimiq Wallet uses the same mechanism as the Electrum desktop wallet, namely the network of ElectrumX servers, provided by institutions and individuals around the world. An upcoming post will go more into the technical details of how we made this work in the browser.  Atomic Swaps  You can get started by using the Nimiq Wallet and easily swap between BTC, the most well-known cryptocurrency, and NIM, the high-performance payment coin. This new atomic swap feature is powered by Fastspot, technology built by Nimiq. We will give you more in-depth information about Fastspot in a future blog post. Fastspot enables atomic swaps, which are a non-custodial way of exchanging two assets, without any participant having control over both of them at the same time. "Atomic" in this context means that the swap either completes successfully, or both parties get their assets returned. To learn more about the security of HTLC-based atomic swaps, check out this article for an in-depth explanation.  To set up a swap, you can either move the slider to set a new ratio between your NIM and BTC holdings, or specify an amount in the input fields. You'll then get a quote from Fastspot that is calculated on the spot. The swap fees are displayed at the top — just hover your mouse over the fees (tap on mobile) — and you’ll get more details on the fee composition. This is an “Early Access” to the swap functionality and thus comes with a 30-day volume limit of US$1000 for every account. Since each swap requires two HTLCs, one on the Bitcoin and one on the Nimiq blockchain, and each HTLC requires two transactions, one for locking up the funds and one for taking them out — network transaction fees are important. At times, Bitcoin transaction fees can get expensive, but with the limit as high as US$1000, the swap fees are actually still very low in comparison.  We plan to offer higher limits in the future. However, we can not yet share a date for when this will be available.  Why Bitcoin?  Bitcoin is the gold standard of crypto. Every other cryptocurrency is measured against Bitcoin and compared to it often. When we launched our Mainnet in 2018, Nimiq's original architecture was inspired by Bitcoin but designed from the ground up to be browser-based. Having a node directly in the browser improved usability and developer accessibility due to its use of JavaScript, while at the same time reducing protocol complexity. All this together made Nimiq a better currency, suitable for day-to-day payments and applications. Ongoing improvements including scalability, energy consumption, transaction speed and cost, will continue with the upcoming Nimiq 2.0.  While some focus on comparing BTC and NIM, we are convinced that there is room for both in the crypto space. As a matter of fact, Nimiq and Bitcoin complement each other as they target different use-cases and coexist perfectly:  Bitcoin, with its slow transaction time, higher cost per transaction, but very high hash power — and thus security — behind it, is a store of value, comparable to gold. People rarely use it to pay daily expenses or go shopping, but instead invest in it for its longer-term stability.  Nimiq, with its high speed and low cost transaction combined with high throughput in the up-coming switch to Proof-of-Stake, is the high performance payment coin, replacing cash or credit card in your pocket for everyday payments between friends and family. The switch to Proof-of-Stake in Nimiq 2.0 will also provide a predictable income stream in the form of staking rewards. This is comparable with interest, that if you are lucky :) you are used to getting from your bank. The significant difference is that you never give up control over your money when staking with Nimiq and you always get a positive rate. We hope that you'll enjoy our brand-new atomic swap experience and appreciate the non-custodial nature of this unique technology. As you might know, the NIM/BTC swap is only the first release of a series of other exciting atomic swap pairs to come - so stay tuned for more news and updates!  Happy swapping and Pura Vida!  Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq joins ranks of the global Blockchain industry in Blockchain for Europe Association]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We are happy to announce that Nimiq has been accepted as a member of the Brussels-based Blockchain for Europe association. Blockchain for Europe represents international blockchain industry players at the EU-level and contributes to the regulatory debate by supporting European decision-makers in their goal to make blockchain technology a success. The association closely collaborates with national and global players – both at legislative as well as industry level – to support the promotion of and education about blockchain technology. Blockchain for Europe’s main objective is to drive integrity, innovation and empowerment through blockchain, mainly within a European context, but also as a thought leader for other countries and jurisdictions around the world. Being based among the most important institutions of the European Union in Brussels, the association is working with the European Commission, Members of the European Parliament and other political stakeholders across the member states to support them with insights and consulting when it comes to blockchain and distributed ledger technology as well as digital assets based on those technologies. The association closely monitors all relevant regulatory developments in the blockchain sector and upcoming EU regulations dealing with applications of blockchain technology, such as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), the DLT Pilot Regime and the upcoming Data Act, a set of new rules for a safer and more open digital space across the whole EU. With a strong focus on education and outreach, Blockchain for Europe strives to foster the development of the new digital economy and helps to shape regulatory foundations for a future of Blockchain-based application, such as cross-border payments. With joining the association, Nimiq aims to underpin the project's effort to become a notable and respected supporter of beneficial European crypto regulations and the blockchain space in general, especially when it comes to cross-border online payments. Besides joining forces for educational and outreach efforts, we are also pleased to join the ranks of a worldwide network of experts, industry influencers and academic partners, represented not only by a strong board and advisory council but — of course — also by the association's fellow members.   A strong focus on education and outreach With education and guidance being a cornerstone of supporting European regulators on their way into a new digital economy, Blockchain for Europe is offering a wide array of educational content such as workshops, webinars and position papers, and soon also podcasts for both regulatory and non-regulatory audiences. Besides that, the association hosts an annual summit held in the European Parliament, bringing together key stakeholders in the blockchain space from Europe and other key global markets including the U.S., South America, Japan, Hong Kong and India. Maria Minaricova (Chairman of the Board of Blockchain for Europe) “Nimiq is a promising blockchain player that specializes in facilitating fast online payments without compromising on data security nor user accessibility. We are delighted to welcome Nimiq and their expertise into our community and are looking forward to working together to extend the outreach and education activities to keep the innovation in Europe at the forefront. The Blockchain space currently offers many interesting developments such as the new EU MiCA regulation proposal promising the creation of an innovation-friendly framework for new technology and we are happy to bring together such a great innovative group of members to grow the blockchain ecosystem.” Max Burger (Nimiq Ambassador) "Getting accepted as a member of Blockchain for Europe is a notable milestone for Nimiq as an organization. Passing the conscientious accession procedure of the association shows that Nimiq has evolved into a respected protagonist in the blockchain space, not only when it comes to regulatory compliance, but also with regard to the teams' technological expertise. We are looking forward to a close and successful collaboration with Blockchain for Europe and will do our best to foster a healthy and prosperous ecosystem development in Europe and beyond." About Nimiq Nimiq makes blockchain technology universally accessible to enable fast, easy and secure online payments. Built cross-platform for the modern desktop or mobile browsers, anyone can join this peer-to-peer payment network directly, pay and accept payments without having to install software or rely on unnecessary intermediaries. This gives Nimiq it's unique "It just works" characteristic, which is further strengthened by a strong philosophy of simplicity and ease of use. NIM is a simple, secure and censorship resistant cryptocurrency - it's modern money, native to the web and ready to deliver crypto's Netscape moment!

            <description><![CDATA[New Elections, Proactive & Reactive Rewards ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This month the Community Funding Board focused on rewarding the great work carried out by Nimiq community members and supporting the proactive initiatives suggested.  The time has also come to hold new elections to vote in the third round of community representatives. So, we’ll dive into all that and more in this blog post. What Went Down In The Meeting? Nimiq Memes The Community Funding Board decided to support the Nimiq Meme Twitter account, which was an initiative started by one of our community members. The Board determined that a small proactive reward should be granted and that the new Twitter account would be given 30k NIM to be used for giveaways and further expand the reach of Nimiq Memes.   Thank you James, keep it going! The Board also recognized that James Warren had become one of the most active posters in Nimiq’s Telegram group over the last three months. James had not only dedicated a lot of time into helping create a very positive vibe in Telegram by making it rain cashlinks, but he had also answered numerous questions from the community to a very high level indeed. The Community Funding Board decided that the time has come to recognize his efforts in the form of a small NIM reward and we certainly hope to continue seeing him around in Telegram for months to come. In terms of ongoing community bounties, Nimiq has received Java and Go RPC client submissions. The core team already reviewed these and community bounties will be distributed for these providing they pass quality assurance tests during the review. New Community Funding Board Elections  | Last election results Nimiq’s vision for the Community Funding Board is to work with three elected community representatives to determine which community initiatives to support and to act in the best interests of Nimiq’s expanding ecosystem. You could say that the ethos is ‘by the community, for the community’.  However, the term for current community representatives is coming to an end. We’d like to thank Matt, Wekkel and Chugwig for their service to the community over the last few months and announce that new Community Funding Board elections will be held. How To Put Yourself Forward As A Community Representative?  Anyone interested in having a deeper say in the Nimiq community and playing a critical role in Nimiq’s future should certainly consider putting themselves forward as a Community Representative candidate.  Team Nimiq recognizes that there are varied interests within the community and that’s why we’d ideally like a community representative from each of these interest groups: A crypto enthusiast  A developer A crypto trader This way we can better serve the overall community as a whole and do our best to ensure that the interests of everyone are represented.  If you think you are up to the challenge, then you should know that: Community representatives are not compensated for their role on the Board. Instead, this gives you the unique opportunity to shape the future of Nimiq and do so for the benefit of the Nimiq community as a whole. Board terms last 6 months. You will be required to attend one monthly meeting and coordinate with other Board members on Telegram/Discord. Be ready to attend the first Community Funding Board meeting (online) on Sunday, March 8 at 15:00 UTC Sounds like something you want to be part of?  Well, put yourself forward as a community representative candidate before midnight, March 2 UTC.   All you need to do is to email richy@nimiq.com or contact Richy on Telegram @RichyBC with a short summary of why you think you’ll make an awesome Community Funding Board Representative. Each new candidate will be announced on Nimiq’s Twitter account in real-time. So make sure you keep your eyes peeled there and start thinking about which candidate you want to vote for. Candidate submissions will close on March 2 at 23:59 UTC. When Elections? After candidate submissions have been closed, the voting app will be configured and we expect the voting to start on March 3 at 02:00 UTC and end March 5 at 23:59 UTC.  Key information To vote, go to voting.nimiq.community and choose your favorite three candidates. We’d like to thank Chugwig again for creating this voting app. Bios for each candidate can be found on the Nimiq Forum.  Vote weightings will be directly proportional to the amount of NIM in your wallet at the end of the voting. Voting begins March 3, 02:00 UTC and ends March 5, 23:59 UTC. Voting addresses will be designated for each candidate and you can submit your vote for just one Luna. Have Your Say  | Last community elections. A total of 113 votes were received. “Elections aren't just about who votes but who doesn't vote.” - Michelle Obama As a NIM stakeholder, it is your right to decide who represents you in the Nimiq Community Funding Board. Use your vote and have your say in the future of Nimiq. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ The Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Testnet was unveiled in Q1 of this year. This release signals the implementation of all major features and the network's stable operation under friendly conditions. Currently, we are focusing on handling unexpected conditions and furthering security and optimization efforts. Nimiq Proof-of-Stake continues to evolve towards its public release; to better update you about this intricate topic, we would like to first examine its main building blocks and their present status. Validators and stakers Validators are the Proof-of-Stake block producers. A validator signals their willingness to participate in the block production by allocating a portion of their funds as stake. The higher its total stake, the higher the probability of being elected. Likewise, the higher the stake, the greater the number of slots assigned to the validator. A set of slots is used to determine the block producers. They are allocated to a validator based on their stake. At every block, a slot is randomly picked to produce the next block, and the validator assigned to it then proceeds to produce it. Slots are also used to cast votes for macro blocks and skip blocks, which will be explored later. A participant who does not have the resources or knowledge to become a validator can instead sign up as a staker. A staker delegates its funds to a validator, which produces and validates blocks on its behalf. While stakers don’t need to be online to receive rewards, they are subject to punishment if their validator misbehaves and cannot withdraw their stake until their validator completes the punishment period. But even in such a situation, stakers do not lose their stake. Additionally, validators make the reward payment to their stakers off-chain. Blockchain Overview The Nimiq PoS blockchain is structured into several subsets of blocks called epochs and batches. An epoch consists of multiple batches. An epoch always ends with a closing election macro block. While, during an epoch, the set of validators remains constant, the election macro block selects a new set of elected validators for the following epoch. Batches consist of micro blocks and a closing checkpoint macro block, like in the following image.  Let’s analyze both in more detail. Micro blocks Micro blocks are produced by a selected validator and are the blocks that contain user-generated transactions. If a validator does not produce a micro block in the expected time, the validator list oversteps and creates a skip block in the expected micro block’s place. Unlike a regular micro block, a skip block does not include transactions and is signed by over two-thirds of the validators of the current epoch. This block replaces the micro block, thus ‘skipping’ past it. Macro blocks After a set amount of micro blocks has been produced, a macro block is added to finalize the batch. A randomly selected leader proposes macro blocks, and the remainder of the validator list vote on the proposal under a two-step voting process. The macro block is added to the chain upon an agreement of more than two-thirds of the validator set. Validators cannot split their votes so always vote with all of their slots, having greater voting power in the case of having a large number of slots. There are two types of macro blocks: election blocks provide periodical finality and renew the validator set for the upcoming epoch, and checkpoint blocks provide finality but retain the validator set. How do we deal with malicious behavior? Validators are rewarded for participating in the block production and penalized if they fail to contribute according to the consensus. Penalties are distinguished based on the severity of the offense. For minor offenses, like delaying the block production, the slot responsible is deactivated and its rewards burned. More severe offenses on the other hand incur locking the validator, including all of its slots, in what is referred to as a jail state, where they remain for a significant amount of time. During this period, the validator cannot be re-elected, and all its rewards are burned. Impact on stakers The jail period also affect the validators’ stakers, as the locking period for the staker's stake matches with the validator's locking period. Once the validator is released, stakers can either maintain their stake along with their validator or opt to remove it once the jail period ends if their stake remains inactive.  Accounts and Transactions There are four distinct account types: Basic accounts, Vesting contracts, HTLC contracts, and the singular staking contract. The account tree hosts all accounts and contracts, documenting their balances and, where applicable, additional contract-specific data. For regular users (non-validators), transactions are your only way to interact with the blockchain. Transactions are therefore used not only for regular transfer of value but also for native functions like signing HTLCs (for Atomic Swaps), creating and redeeming Vesting contracts, initiating stakers, and more. Node Types Participants can engage in the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake network through various node types, each boasting different features and resource requirements: History Nodes: These nodes possess complete transaction history knowledge. In Nimiq Proof-of-Work, this type of node was referred to as a "Full node", and even though the name has changed in the Proof-of-Stake protocol, it continues to act as a keeper of the entire transaction history. Full Nodes: These nodes maintain essential information needed for block validation and production. In the transition from Nimiq PoW to Nimiq PoS, what was once known as a "Light node" has been renamed to "Full node", yet it retains its core function of maintaining all vital blockchain information. Light Nodes: Light nodes quickly sync with the Blockchain since they only request details relevant to their accounts. While browsers are the typical platforms for light nodes, servers can also function as such. Previously in Nimiq Proof-of-Work, this kind of node was labeled a "Nano node". Browser Nodes Utilizing the same Rust codebase as the standard client, the Nimiq web client swiftly syncs and serves as a network node capable of directly transmitting transactions and getting verified blockchain data. Nimiq Zero Knowledge Proof Implementation The Nimiq Proof-of-Stake implementation utilizes recursive Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to maintain constant data size for blockchain syncing, thereby enhancing speed and efficiency. If you want to learn more about ZKPs, you can read the series of blog posts we wrote on this topic: Intro to Zero Knowledge Proofs Part 1 and Part 2. In general, Zero Knowledge Proofs are a concept that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the statement itself. In other words, it’s a method to prove something without revealing the actual secret. Recursive ZKPs enhance efficiency and scalability by breaking proofs down into smaller sub-proofs. The proof system that Nimiq utilizes is grounded in zk-SNARKs. SNARK is an acronym for ‘succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,’ and a recursive SNARK is a proof that verifies another SNARK in turn. SNARKs are a form of zero-knowledge proof that requires no interaction between the parties involved. They are succinct, meaning the verifier can quickly check a proof with a straightforward request to the prover. Nimiq’s blockchain includes a special node responsible for generating these proofs - the prover node. While verifying ZKPs can be done quickly, generating them is resource-intensive and demands high computational power. Full or history nodes can facilitate this effort by enabling the prover node feature in their configuration. With the incorporation of this technology, Nimiq can now sync the blockchain without necessitating the download of the entire blockchain. This synchronization is possible as the current state of the blockchain can be validated by proving that validators have produced the blocks in accordance with the consensus rules. Furthermore, this approach significantly reduces the amount of storage space required on the user’s device, a particularly crucial factor for mobile devices. This enhancement is a significant stride forward in user experience, making the Nimiq platform easier and faster to use. Nimiq's ZKPs enable users to sync up to the latest election block. A ZKP is approximately 1 kilobyte in size, and its verification process takes about 600ms in a modern browser. On the other hand, the process of creating a proof, or proving, is more time-intensive. Currently, it takes about 6 hours to generate a ZKP for a new epoch. These proofs are formulated and provided by prover nodes within the network. Outlook until Mainnet The testnet provides the community with an opportunity to explore Nimiq Proof-of-Stake’s functionality on a continuously operating chain. As community developers base their projects on the current code and new network, we invite everyone to push the network to its limits and identify potential security vulnerabilities. Team Nimiq is dedicating time and resources to strengthen the protocol and implementation, the ZKP public bug bounty program is currently open for submissions and we will open up the scope to include a wider section of the code base shortly. We aim to present a Blockchain Network that is a Mainnet Release Candidate after thorough testing.  We appreciate your continued support and participation in this journey. Stay tuned to our social media channels for more exciting updates coming your way.  Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[New community bounties, reactive rewards and more!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This month the Community Funding Board focused on creating new bounties and recognizing the contributions of even more community members through the Board’s reactive reward scheme.  2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Nimiq with key releases like a move to proof-of-stake, Albatross, Nimiq OASIS and much, much more in the works. However, Nimiq is also fortunate to be the home of some of the most talented developers in the crypto space who certainly have the skills and determination to help further accelerate the growth of the Nimiq ecosystem.  One thing is for sure; it’s going to be a big year for Nimiq and it’s finally time to start making waves in the wider crypto community. The constant expansion of the ecosystem is of course key and that’s why the Community Funding Board has recently prioritized the creation of new community bounties and reward schemes.  In terms of the lastest Community Funding Board meeting, this is what went down… New RPC Client Bounties  To put the importance of RPC clients into context, you should know that Nimiq has some exciting new tech innovations set to launch in 2020. This includes initiatives like Nimiq OASIS which will power a new way for merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies and be settled almost instantly in Euros direct to their bank account. All this whilst being completely non-custodial. Then you have Albatross, which is a new proof-of-stake algorithm that performs close to the theoretical maximum for a single blockchain.   The project is on the verge of upgrading to one of the fastest possible single blockchains, as well as being the first project to deliver fiat smart contracts with a helping hand from our friends at Ten31 bank. With all this happening in the background, we think Nimiq will attract even more developers and the Team wants to make it as easy for them to participate and build in the Nimiq ecosystem as possible. That’s where RPC clients can help by making Nimiq compatible with different programming languages. In other words, the creation of RPC client libraries means that even more developers can build on Nimiq whilst using their preferred programming language. This opens up the Nimiq ecosystem to an even bigger pool of developer talent. With all that in mind, the Community Funding Board decided to add the following RPC client libraries to the list of community bounties and allocate the following priorities and bounties:  Rust - medium | 400K NIM C# - medium | 400K NIM Because Nimiq already focuses on Rust, it made sense to add Rust to the bounty list and have a Rust RPC client. C# was added to the bounty list because it is a popular .net language. Other programming languages like NIM and Hax were also considered for a bounty. However, seeing that these other options are neither core nor in the top 50 most popular programming languages, they were passed over for community bounty rewards for now. However, the Community Funding Board does want to make it clear that just because a language is not on the ‘approved list of community bounties’, it shouldn’t deter you from going ahead and contributing.   In the case that a community member develops anything that’s actually being used, then the Board commits to reactively rewarding those initial efforts. That’s what Board reactive rewards are for and how they intend to be used and distributed moving forward. A Little More On RPC Client Bounties  We’ve been asked a few times about the RPC client review process. So, we thought we’d tell you all about it here. Put simply, once you send the Community Funding Board your RPC client submission, it will then be reviewed by the Nimiq core team. If it passes the review, the bounty is then distributed.  Also, since the meeting, we are happy to tell you that the community developer Stefan has already begun work on the Rust bounty. Reactive Rewards Our community representative, Wekkle, brought up an interesting conversation he had with a Nimiq community member. In short, the proposed initiative was to create a bounty reward scheme for non-technical community members to participate in to support Nimiq. This involves distributing NIM rewards for certain actions such as liking a Nimiq related Reddit post. The Community Funding Board expressed interest in the concept, saw potential value in this guerilla marketing and liked the concept of a community effort for non-technical supporters. However, the Board determined that it was best to wait until the meeting next month to see a full proposal before making a judgment.   The NIM4 game was the result of a collaboration between Chugwig and Harley. Essentially it’s a tiered lottery style game where one of ten entrants are selected at random to be the winner and progressed to the next round for a shot at even bigger prizes. The Board decided to recognize and reward the effort. Finally… The Community Funding Board is still accepting proposals for funding and mentoring. If you have a great concept or vision but need some help to make it happen, then the Board would love to hear from you. All you need to do is to read our proposal submission guide and shoot off an email to Proposals@Nimiq.com. Together, let’s make 2020 a year to remember.  Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Syncing in seconds thanks to ZPKs with nano nodes in Nimiq 2.0.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Looking back, nano syncing in Nimiq 1.0 worked by leveraging two technologies: light clients and NiPoPoWs. How is that going to work in Nimiq 2.0 with Proof-of-Stake? Let’s get into the technical details with this blog post series. One of the big strengths of Nimiq are the nano nodes and how they allow anyone to sync and connect to the blockchain from a regular phone in just a few seconds. They enable us to deliver Nimiq’s vision of making crypto accessible to the masses. Light clients are ubiquitous in crypto and simply refer to nodes that only download the headers of the block and ignore both the transactions and the state. This evidently greatly reduces the amount of data that a user needs to download, but it still is too much for a browser or a mobile. Even Bitcoin, with its small block headers and very large block time, requires its light clients to download roughly 50 MB to sync from the genesis block. And that number is growing at a steady 4 MB per year. Calculating these numbers is simple as Bitcoin block headers are always 80 bytes. For Nimiq, with a blocktime of one minute and a header of 146 bytes, the size would be almost twenty-fold. That is not light at all 😉. NiPoPoWs, or Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work, are short proofs that can prove that a given amount of computational power was spent in producing a chain of blocks, without the need of taking all block headers into account. In essence, it allows a light client to sync the blockchain while downloading only a small fraction of all the block headers. Without getting too technical, it does this by identifying blocks that greatly exceed their difficulty target, which happens now and then. If you want to read more on the topic, check out nipopows.com or the Nimiq 1.0 whitepaper. However, now that Nimiq is transitioning to a Proof-of-Stake-based protocol, we can no longer use NiPoPoWs, since they are specific to Proof-of-Work. So, we started to work on a novel solution to deliver Nimiq’s vision of being browser-first. It turned out, developing nano nodes for a PoS blockchain is an interesting challenge as the blockchain research community is just starting to work on this field. Thanks to the efforts of the team’s researchers, Bruno and Pascal, and their longstanding experience in scientific and blockchain research, a solution using zero knowledge proofs has been found! With this post we will explain, in some technical detail, what were the issues we faced and how we found an optimal solution. If you want to meet Bruno and Pascal, check out this video where they explain Nimiq 2.0 tech.  Warning, technical content ahead! 🤓 To get the best out of this post, you should have a basic understanding of what elliptic curves, zero knowledge proofs — or ZKPs for short — and SNARKs are. And here are some resources for those interested in diving deeper: The best site for ZKPs is zkp.science. It's a collection of resources about ZKPs. Also, this GitHub repo has some great links to further reading Or read Vitalik’s famous three post series on ZKPs: First, second, third. Albatross, the new consensus algorithm in Nimiq 2.0, will have a block time on the order of one second. That means, while Bitcoin produces 52’560 blocks per year, Nimiq 2.0 will produce 86’400 blocks per day! While this performance improvement is incredible, with so many blocks being produced, syncing the blockchain becomes a new unexpected challenge. Now, let’s have a look at how a light client works in Albatross. A regular light client in other blockchains forces the user to download all of the block headers from genesis to the current time. This is necessary in order to find out what the most recent block is. Next, the user can request Merkle proofs to whatever part she is interested in. Merkle proofs allow a light client to verify that a given transaction, or account, is part of a block without needing to download the entire block.   Albatross, like many other PoS algorithms, picks a random set of nodes to be validators — called the validator set — and lets them produce a fixed number of blocks — which is called an epoch. At the end of an epoch, a new set of nodes will be randomly picked. In Albatross, macro blocks mark the end of an epoch and the beginning of another one, it’s where the validator set changes. Between any two macro blocks, the validator set doesn’t change, that means that we can safely skip all of the micro blocks between two macro blocks. So, a light client in Albatross would download only the macro block headers since genesis to the most recent one and all of the micro block headers produced in the current epoch. Then, once again, the user can ask for Merkle proofs for parts of the state.  Skipping the micro blocks is already a huge improvement. Macro blocks might only happen once per day — the exact frequency is still to be decided — while micro blocks happen tens of thousands of times per day. Let’s do some math. Considering that a block header for a PoS chain needs to include the public keys of each validator and assuming 1024 validators per epoch, that will give us 290kB for the public keys only. Then, a quick calculation — assuming a macro block header of 300kB and one macro block being produced per day — shows us that the required download would grow to 109MB within just one year. That is too much for a web and mobile environment! This got us on the journey of finding a better solution: Zero knowledge proofs, more specifically zk-SNARKs! Zk-SNARKs, or Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, are probably the most famous type of zero knowledge proofs and have found a lot of use cases in blockchain recently. As a zero knowledge proof, they are known for their ability to prove arbitrary statements without revealing any other information other than that the statement is true. This property is leveraged by Zcash, which is also arguably the first blockchain to make extensive use of zero knowledge proofs. However, we are not interested in the zero knowledge property of SNARKs but rather on its succinctness.  Succinctness refers to the ability of SNARKs to take a statement of any size and prove its correctness with a very small proof that is very quick to verify. A statement in this case can be a simple calculation or an entire program that returns true or false. So, in other words, this allows us to do some large calculation and then produce a proof that the calculation was performed correctly. Then, anyone can simply check the proof instead of redoing the same calculation. SNARKs are exceptionally succinct, producing proofs with sizes of a few hundreds bytes that take only milliseconds to verify. If you want to dive deeper, consider reading this article. Normally, a light client needs to download all of the macro block headers to verify that the last macro block header it received is indeed authentic. All of those intermediate macro block headers are just a way of getting from the genesis macro block to the most recent macro block. So here lies the optimal solution: Using the succinctness of SNARKs to compress all that computation into a small proof! That leads us to nano nodes. While light nodes need to download all of the macro block headers, nano nodes only ask for the most recent one and a SNARK attesting to the fact that there is a valid chain of macro block headers that start with the genesis block and end in the most recent block. Note, we can assume that it has the genesis macro block header already as it is public knowledge. The SNARK is enough for the node to be convinced that the macro block header that it received is valid. After that, it just needs to download the headers of the micro blocks in the current epoch plus whatever Merkle proofs it needs.  This ideal solution would mean that a user can sync with the blockchain in a few seconds maximum. The data that needs to be downloaded would include the last macro block header of ~300kB, tiny 200 bytes for the SNARK, about 400 bytes for each micro block headers in the current epoch and ~200 bytes for all the necessary Merkle proofs. So, in total, we're talking about ~400-500 kB to sync. That is completely doable in a mobile/browser environment! But the best part is that the syncing time will never increase! Indeed, it’s a fixed size, no matter how large the Nimiq blockchain grows, it will stay the same! However, while verifying SNARKS is very quick, creating them is a big effort. So, while it’s theoretically possible to create one new SNARK verifying the entire chain of macro blocks at the end of each epoch, it would put a big burden on the validator. Instead, we are using a strategy where our SNARK proof will be extended with each new macro block without growing the size of the proof. We can do this by using a very recent, very promising technique called “recursive SNARKs”. This has been a long and technical post, thanks for coming with us on this journey. Let’s take a break and explore the specifics on how to achieve this in part 2 of this series. Pura vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Refreshed account-creation and purchase of NIM using credit cards!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We have updated our account-creation process in the Nimiq Keyguard. It now features a beautiful animation while you enter and confirm your password, and requires that users download the Login File for their newly created account. iOS and Safari users also receive some love! The need for a backup Since launching the Nimiq Wallet we have learned from new users on Twitter and Telegram that they set up a new account, had NIM transferred into it, and then lost access to the account because they had no backup. Sometimes the browser just “forgets” about the account, sometimes people use an incognito tab and close it, sometimes their computer crashes and all is gone.   We have had a big orange warning in the wallet, visible directly when users return from the Keyguard, plus a welcome message that concludes in a prompt to download the Login File. However, this method fails to account for accounts created in another flow, like when redeeming a cashlink for the first time. If the user does not visit the wallet after redeeming their first cashlink, there is a risk of loosing access to the wallet.   We initially designed the account-creation process with the purpose of being the quickest, simplest, and easiest signup to crypto possible. And we still think our Login Files are a great improvement over writing down the full 24 recovery words (recovery words are still very important - and users still get prompted to export them from the wallet). We have now made downloading the Login File a requirement, to make sure all new users have a backup of their account in a persistent location. Buy NIM & BTC with Credit Card  We are happy to announce our in-wallet integration with Moonpay and their global crypto-payments infrastructure. Click on the “Buy/Sell” button in the left sidebar of your Wallet and select “To Moonpay”. The Moonpay interface will be loaded right inside your Wallet and the NIM and BTC you buy will be directly deposited into your respective Wallet address. Please note that Moonpay requires creating an account with them and requires KYC for purchases above a certain limit per month. Improvements for iOS & Safari iOS & Safari users surely noticed how their BTC account was not automatically enabled after creating a new account, requiring an extra, sometimes long-loading BTC-activation process. Also, their account name was not properly displayed in the wallet, instead showing a number in its place. We found and squashed both of these issues, for a better experience on iDevices and Macs. Translations Our translators have been busy! As such this update includes lots of new Chinese translations, along with improvements in other languages as well. Bug fixes & performance  We fixed an edge-case that should prevent some Swaps from failing, removed unused code from our bundles, and improved some visuals and UI glitches. How to update The update for the Keyguard is automatic. The next time you create an account, you will be greeted by the new account-creation experience.  For the updates in the Wallet (like the iOS BTC activation and Moonpay), you will see a green dot next to the “Settings” menu item after a few seconds the next time you open the Wallet. Follow it to the settings and click “Update now” to get the new and shiny stuff. ✨ Happy Nimiqing!]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq is collaborating with Hummingbot to allow Nimiq supporters to earn rewards by adding liquidity to the Nimiq Ecosys]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Providing an easy way for newcomers to get into Nimiq is vital for the overall health of the Ecosystem. SuperSimpleSwap is a great way for users in the European Union to get NIM at a steady market price. For crypto users outside of the EU, exchanges like KuCoin remain the best option. Without good liquidity in an exchange, it would become difficult to buy NIM while maintaining the expected market price. That is why having good liquidity becomes important. Nimiq is collaborating with Hummingbot to allow Nimiq supporters to earn rewards by adding liquidity to the Nimiq Ecosystem in a process called Liquidity Mining. Do you want to participate? We have created a step-by-step guide based on Hummingbot's quickstart guide to get you started. Please note that liquidity mining is a process that requires trading and technical knowledge. Get started with Liquidity Mining Watch this YouTube video to get started, or read the Hummingbot guide. Prerequisites: Kucoin Account (including NIM or USDT on trading account) Linux/Mac/Windows PC Step-by-step guide 1. Create API keys 1.1 Go to the API management section of the Kucoin website:  1.2 Find the Create API command to create two API keys. 1.3 The first API key should have Enable Reading checked in setup. This will be used to create the snapshots that hummingbot miner will read to calculate rewards. In the next section, you will add this key to the Hummingbot Miner app, which allows it to verify your bot’s activity and allocate your rewards. (Read-only key: used by Hummingbot Miner to track and verify your order data in order to allocate rewards to you. Additional verification steps may be needed, including two-factor authentication (2FA) or verification by SMS/email.) 1.4 In KuCoin, you can create a read-only API by only checking the General option and leaving Trade unchecked:  1.5 The second key should be trade enabled. Later, you will use this API key with the Hummingbot client to allow it to place and fill orders on a connected exchange. (Trade key: used by the Hummingbot software to run an automated bot that automatically creates and cancels orders) 1.6 For each API key, make sure to save the API key, secret key, and passphrase (if required), since the exchange only shows them to you upon creation. You will need the public and secret keys for both APIs in the following steps! Afterwards, you should have two keys, a read-only key and a trade-enabled key:  2. Configure Hummingbot Miner 2.1 Navigate to Hummingbot Miner, and click on Log in 2.2 Select Sign up 2.3 Enter your email address, read and agree to the Terms of Service, then click on Create account 2.4 Check your email to confirm your account 2.5 On the Hummingbot Miner email, click on Log in to Hummingbot Miner.

            <description><![CDATA[Digging deeper into the technology behind ZPKs and nano nodes in Nimiq 2.0.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last post we discussed how the nano nodes in Nimiq 2.0 and Albatross are going to use SNARKs in order to vastly reduce the time that it takes to sync the blockchain. But we did not explain the inner workings of the SNARK proofs that we are going to use. In this part we will go deeper down into the technical details and explain how these proofs are created and what this means for the performance of Nimiq 2.0. Time to put on the smarty-pants glasses. 🤓 Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs Let’s start with a simple example (inspired by this article) that illustrates how the process of challenge-response works. We have two people: Alice and Bob. Alice doesn’t believe Bob can see colors, but Bob swears he can. To prove that, Alice holds colored hexagons in her hands and shows them to Bob.  Alice: I am holding a red hexagon and a blue hexagon. I will now put my hands behind my back, so you cannot see. During this time, I may or may not exchange the hexagons between my hands. Afterwards, I will show you the hexagons again. Bob: OK, so you want me to tell you if you switched the hexagons or not. Alice: Correct, only someone who can see color will be able to consistently tell me what I did. In this case, Alice is verifying that Bob can indeed see colors, she is the verifier. While Bob is proving that he can see colors, he is the prover. For this to work, Alice needs to keep the verification process hidden, hiding her hands behind her back and making sure Bob does not see whether or not she switched the hexagons. Interestingly, Alice herself does not need to know which color each hexagon is, as far as she is concerned, only knowing that Bob can detect if she is switching them or not is enough to convince her that he can differentiate the colors of the hexagons. Alice: Are the colors in the same hands? Bob: Yes. Alice: How about now? Bob: Nope. Every time Alice challenges Bob, she gets a response. With enough responses she can be statistically certain that Bob can see colors. Every challenge/response is called an interaction. In this case, Alice needs a set of interactions to be performed before she is certain that Bob can see colors. Zero Knowledge Proofs can also be non-interactive, which does not require the effort of a challenge-response interaction and also allows multiple parties to verify Alice’s claims, not just Bob.  Non-Interactive Knowledge Proofs Let’s change the example and analyze how Non-Interactive Knowledge Proof and SNARKs work. From a blockchain's perspective it’s very important that the proof is non-interactive because then it does not require the prover to be online and available for “questioning” at all times, instead, a static piece of data, the proof, is sufficient for one or many verifiers that can verify the proof independently.  The first thing to know about Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (SNARKs) is that they have circuits and witnesses. By circuit we mean the program or function that is part of the statement that we are trying to prove. By witness we mean the specific values that make our statement true. For example, if we are trying to prove the statement “I know a number y such that y2 – 4 = 0” then the circuit would be the function “y2 – 4 = 0” while the witness would be the number 2 because 22 – 4 = 0 is true. Thinking of the blockchain world, you can imagine the circuit to be a test whether the current blockchain is valid and the witness being the blocks in the chain. From a programmer's perspective, the circuit is the logic and the witnesses are the data.  Private Witnesses Another important detail is that witnesses can be public or private. Private witnesses are the ones that are known only to the prover, while public witnesses are the ones that are known to everyone, including the verifier. In the previous example the number y is a private witness. It is the prover that is saying that she knows that number, but she is not revealing it. This is a very important feature of zero knowledge proofs since it allows someone to prove something that they know without revealing what they know. A real world application of this property is that I can use a SNARK to prove that I know the secret key to a Nimiq wallet with 10 million NIMs in it, without actually revealing my secret key or even the address. For the curious reader that checks all the footnotes: This example is actually pretty interesting and the concept used here is a big part of the circuit that Zcash uses. Without going into too much detail, imagine that you already have the latest block and checked that it’s valid. Then, I can prove to you that 1) I know a Merkle path from the state root to some data, 2) that that data contains a public key and that it contains the balance that I said, 3) that I know the secret key to that public key. Bingo! Public Witnesses Adding a public witness to the previous example from before: “I know a number y such that y2 – 4 = x, where x is a number provided by you.” You can imagine x to be something meaningful and publicly known, something according to which the verifier wants to make sure that the prover either knows the secret or has performed a certain process. Back to the blockchain world, x could be the latest block and thus the proof proving that this block is indeed the last block of a valid blockchain. Now, let’s imagine that the prover chooses y = 3 and wants to create a proof that she knows y under the condition of a known x. So she creates a proof with the private witness of y = 3 and the public witness of x = 5. For all we have to know, the resulting proof is a piece of data with a fixed length of around 200 bytes. Though, technically speaking, it's actually three points on an elliptic curve. 🤓 Now that we have the proof, the verifier can take that proof and put in the x that she wants to verify the proof for. Evidently, if the verifier chooses x = 5 (imagine this to be, for example, the current block height) then the verification will output true, while choosing x = 3 it will output false (input those numbers and try it yourself!).  Note that this is a very simplified explanation. The formula here seems to reveal y, but that is not the case in reality, it's very complex math and it is indeed possible to do this without revealing y. You can imagine the proof to be similar to a hash to some degree, you can verify that it’s correct very quickly but even better than a hash, you don’t have to know the original data to verify it.  Another, more abstract — and way less correct! 🤭 — way of how you could imagine this is a proof being some form of an outline. The secret is hidden but the verifier — having some shape that the secret has to match — can understand that the given outline of the secret would fit. 🤔 Back to the topic. Public witnesses allow us to have more flexible circuits that can prove more things. While before we could only prove “y2 – 4 = 0”, if we add the public witness x to make “y2 – 4 = x” then we can prove “y2 – 4 = 0” or “y2 – 4 = 1” or “y2 – 4 = 2” … And we can use the same circuit for all these proofs! This is very important because it turns out that SNARKs only work with “fixed” circuits. The Structure of SNARKs Diving deeper into the structure of SNARKs, we realize that they are composed of three parts or algorithms: The parameter generation. Where we take the circuit and calculate a proving key and a verification key. Without going into too much detail, these keys are similar to the public and private keys that are used in digital signatures and encryption. Each specific circuit will have a corresponding proving key and verification key. The proof generation. Where we take the proving key, the private and the public witnesses, and calculate a proof out of it. The proof verification. Where we take the verification key, the proof and the public witnesses and check if the proof is true. So, but how does this all come together in the nano nodes? Let’s see in more detail what our SNARK might look like. A naive way of doing it would be to try to prove that we know all macro blocks from the genesis macro block all the way to the latest macro block. Imagine we have N macro blocks. The blocks number 1 and N (the genesis block and the latest one) would be the public witnesses, the blocks from 2 to N-1 would be the private witnesses and the circuit would be the program that checks that each macro block is valid and that they form a valid chain.  As we have said before, SNARK circuits are fixed. If we want to change the circuit, then we need to run the parameter generation algorithm again and produce new proving and verifying keys. This is problematic for our naive strategy, if we create a circuit that verifies exactly N macro blocks, then when macro block number N+1 is produced, we need to create a new circuit that verifies N+1 blocks. To do this, we also need to create new verifying and proving keys. At first glance, it might not look like a problem — after all, the keys are always the same size — but in practice it would not work. First, these keys need to be created securely by a trusted entity, in our case Team Nimiq. If Team Nimiq (for some reason) becomes unavailable then the nano nodes would not be able to sync newer blocks. This is a central point of failure that we need to avoid. Second, the nano nodes would need to download the latest verifying key whenever they want to sync. They need to download it from a trusted source because they have no way of checking the correctness of the key. If we were going to force the nano nodes to connect to a trusted source whenever they want to sync, we might as well just give them only the last macro block. Of course, this is not acceptable. We want the verifying key to be like the genesis block. It should be created at the beginning and never change afterwards. This way the verifying key can be included with the nano node's source code. We are now going to try a less naive way of solving the problem. Instead of having a circuit that verifies exactly N macro blocks, we can have a circuit that verifies up to N macro blocks. Just like the previous circuit, it will also take as public witnesses the first and the last macro blocks and all the other N-2 macro blocks as private witnesses. The difference now is that we will add another public witness that is simply the current block height. We can now modify the circuit so that it only checks the validity of the blocks up to the current block height.  For example, imagine that the current block height is N-50. The prover will use the N-50 macro blocks that exist so far plus 50 “fake” macro blocks (these are just blocks with any data in them, they don’t need to be valid) as private witnesses. The circuit then will verify the validity of all of the N macro blocks but will only enforce that the first N-50 are indeed valid. With this simple change we can now verify any number of blocks up to a predefined maximum. Then, when we have more than N macro blocks we simply produce several proofs, one proof for each chunk of N macro blocks. Note that the nano nodes still only need one verifying key, as we wanted, instead they receive several proofs. This was actually the first strategy that we pursued when implementing the nano nodes. However, we soon found out that it was not a viable option. For this strategy to be useful we needed a circuit that would be able to prove several hundred macro blocks at once. Otherwise, the number of proofs that the nano nodes need to download and verify grows too fast. Unfortunately, we realized that verifying even a single macro block is a very intensive computation and a normal laptop could only prove a chain with a couple (below ten!) of macro blocks. This was a big problem because we want people to be able to create these proofs on regular consumer hardware. If people need a supercomputer to create proofs then no one outside of the Nimiq team will do it, and that will create another central point of failure. Not cool. ❌ 😉 After some more research, we finally found a way to solve our problem: by using recursive SNARKs. Cool. ✔️ 😎 Remember that we said in the previous blog post that SNARKs can prove any statement or computation? Well, they can also prove the verification of other SNARK proofs! That means, if I have the statement “I know a proof P that is valid with the verifying key V” then I can produce a proof for that. This is important because now we can have SNARKs that verify other SNARKs that verify other SNARKs… and so on — that’s why we call them recursive SNARKs. Recursive SNARKs actually require more complex math than regular SNARKs (for the curious reader, we need to use elliptic curve cycles) but we will not touch on that topic so that we can keep this blog post simple(r). With recursive SNARKs we can now create a much better solution! Just like before, imagine that we have N macro blocks and the nano node knows the first and the last blocks. Our circuit now proves this statement “I know a valid block N-1 and I also know a SNARK proof that proves that there are valid blocks from 1 to N-2”. Obviously this is a proof that there are valid blocks from 1 to N-1, but the prover only had to verify a single macro block and one SNARK proof. And now, when a new macro block is created, the block number N+1, the prover can again prove the statement “I know a valid block N and I also know a SNARK proof that proves that there are valid blocks from 1 to N-1”. So, the previous proof now becomes a private witness to the new proof. This pattern starts at the genesis block and we can continue it for an infinite amount of blocks!  This solution meets all of our requirements: The circuit never changes so we only need to create the verifying and proving keys one time. The circuit is small enough that it can be proven on a regular computer in an acceptable amount of time. Not only small, it’s fixed size for all eternity! 😎 Another advantage is that the prover doesn’t actually need to know all of the macro blocks in order to create a proof. She just needs to know the penultimate block and the previous proof. This explanation glosses over a lot of what happens in this circuit, which is in fact very complex and at the same time very interesting. The more techie readers might want to check out our GitHub repo where there is more documentation and code! Summing it all up: we achieved an optimal solution! We have a decentralized, secure and fast way for users to sync with the Nimiq blockchain and it will stay fast even as the blockchain grows. We are very excited to finish implementing and testing this cutting-edge technology in Nimiq 2.0! Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A technical look under the hood of Nimiq’s Atomic Swaps.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, welcome! As Nimiq OASIS is nearing its public release with both buying and selling of NIM and BTC enabled, we thought it would be interesting for the more tech-savvy Nimiq fans out there to learn how the atomic swaps in the Nimiq Wallet actually work! What are atomic swaps and why do we need them? Cryptocurrencies are all about decentralization and removing the middlemen — with the goal of being able to exchange value with a complete stranger without requiring up-front trust. Open blockchains do a great job on offering transactions between anyone without any trust required upfront. But what if you want to change coin A for coin B? Or even exchange coins for something else, like Euro? Usually nowadays, you will move your coins to an exchange and cash out to Euro. Or you send Euros via bank transfer or credit card and buy crypto. But when you do that, you depend on that service to deliver the counter value to you. If they change their mind, for example demand extra documents, or simply get hacked, then your funds are inaccessible or even gone. That’s where atomic swaps shine! They allow you to swap two assets without needing to trust a middleman to handle your funds and exchange them. Instead, both assets get locked up on their respective chain — or if it’s about Euro, then in a bank using the OASIS API — and are then exchanged atomically, which means they are either both exchanged or they will go back to their previous owners. No other outcome is possible. That makes it very safe because even if something goes wrong, you will never lose your funds. That’s why atomic swaps are so important! Are you wondering how that works specifically? You came to the right place! Let’s dive into the juicy technical details of how atomic swaps are prepared and performed in the Nimiq Wallet. Step 0: Enter amounts to be swapped The first thing you’ll do when atomic-swapping with Nimiq is entering how much you want to buy or sell and let Fastspot — a market-rate liquidity provider for atomic swaps — make you an offer. Side-note for developers: Fastspot provides quite a few options for requesting swap estimates. You can specify what amount you want to send or receive and if you want to exclude or include fees in that estimate, enabling a wallet to insert its own calculated transaction fees for example. Developers can read the Fastspot API documentation and use the Typescript library to get started. The Nimiq Wallet respects the minimum fee-per-byte suggested by Fastspot for both NIM and BTC to ensure swaps will be completed as fast and smooth as possible. For NIM, these fees are usually zero, and for BTC the wallet knows how many of your UTXOs will be used for the swap and calculates the transaction fees accordingly. Furthermore, the wallet displays the true swap rate in the interface, listing all fees from both sides of the swap separately.  Once you are happy with the amounts to be swapped, you’ll click the “Confirm” button to trigger the next step.  Step 1: Create, verify and sign the swap To sign a swap, we first need… to have one! That’s right, we haven't initiated a swap yet. What we got so far is an estimate. An estimate from Fastspot gives no guarantee about the available liquidity or whether the selected assets can actually be swapped currently. For example, the EUR asset might be disabled for maintenance. So to get started, we get a definite quote first which includes the guarantee that a swap is actually possible and can be executed. The wallet is requesting a quote from Fastspot at the moment you click the confirm button. The quoted amounts should be the same or very close to the estimate displayed before. Together with your destination and refund addresses involved in the swap and the fees calculated for your transactions, the wallet forwards the details of the swap to the Keyguard. The Keyguard will show you the amounts, swap rate, and fees for you to make sure everything is correct. Now we arrive at an important detail. So far, the swap has not been confirmed with Fastspot. What does that mean? It means nothing has happened yet on-chain for this swap. It also means this swap does not yet count against your swap limits and canceling the process here, before entering your password, has no consequences. However, the quote that the swap is based on is only valid for around 15 minutes, so if not confirmed with your password within that time, you have to start over. OK, so you entered your password and confirmed your intention to do the swap. The Keyguard — technically speaking the Hub, but for the purpose of this explanation we can consider them to be the same — now takes both your destination and refund addresses and sends them to Fastspot to confirm the quote. Fastspot then generates and returns the contract details that will be used for this swap. For NIM and BTC this is binary data encoding the rules of the respective contract, and for EUR this is the ID of an OASIS contract. Before the Keyguard-Hub-combo now actually signs your transactions and returns them to the wallet for execution, these contract details that Fastspot just generated are validated. It is verified that your addresses are actually used in the contract data as the beneficiary and refund addresses, that the unlock-hash in both contracts is the same, that the contract expiration timestamps are in the correct order, etc. In short, it is verified that the swap will be atomic. Only if all those checks pass does the Keyguard sign the transactions and return them to the wallet. Right... [mental breathing pause...] that was long and a bit complex. Feel free to go back and read this section again. We hope it is clearer now why this process is necessary to ensure a non-custodial, trustless swap. Now that everything is prepared, we can move on to the actual on-chain part! Step 2: Wait for the incoming contract Let’s recap the situation we are in. The Keyguard just signed two transactions - one to fund a contract and one to redeem a contract — it also signed a third refund transaction, but let’s skip that for now. The wallet still knows what swap they are for and stores the transactions for now as they will only be sent in the next steps. The wallet then fetches the confirmed swap object from the Fastspot API to learn about which contracts are involved in the swap and to confirm that the swap is still happening. For swaps involving EUR, the wallet also fetches the EUR-HTLC, including its funding details, directly from OASIS to not rely on Fastpot to correctly forward this information. Since Fastspot controls the secret of the swap, it is also the first to create an on-chain HTLC contract, namely the contract that locks up the currency that you are going to receive. We need to wait for this contract to be created irreversibly. For NIM this means waiting for the creation transaction to be mined into a block, for BTC it is enough when the transaction is in the mempool — with ‘replace-by-fee’ disabled — and for EUR this means OASIS reporting the contract to be cleared — FinTech-speak for ‘funded’. The wallet, via a swap-library — soon to be available for other projects as a package — monitors the respective blockchain or OASIS API for the criteria mentioned above, including validating that the amount, ownership, and expiry of the contract is correct. You as the user see this waiting period as the puzzle piece animating its labyrinth of lines and finally being filled with full color.  Step 3: Fund the outgoing contract Once the wallet is certain that Fastpot held up its part of the deal, the contract committing your side of the swap is created. This works the same way Fastspot did it: the wallet simply broadcasts your funding transaction, which you signed in the Keyguard earlier, to the respective blockchain. For EUR, it displays the payment details that you should use to send a SEPA Instant transaction to fund the OASIS contract. Again, we need to wait for the contract to be created irrevocably, meaning mined for Nimiq, in the mempool for Bitcoin, and status “cleared” in OASIS. Fastspot also waits for that. Note: It can happen that the BTC transaction fees have risen sharply between when the swap quote was created and when your BTC transaction is sent. In this case, Fastspot can not accept your BTC transaction just because it is in the mempool. Instead, it requires that the transaction gets mined, which in the Bitcoin network can take a few more minutes. Once both puzzle pieces are fully filled out, the contracts are ready and the ownership of the assets can be swapped. Step 4: Atomic swap! In atomic swaps, ownership change happens with the publishing of the swap secret. Remember how the wallet verified in step 1 that both contracts are secured by the same unlock-hash? It is now vital that they are indeed equal. First, Fastspot claims the contract that you created and transfers the funds out into its own wallet. To do that, Fastspot must include the swap secret — the key to unlock the contracts — into that claiming transaction! Put differently, it needs to present the key to be able to unlock the funds. Since the involved blockchains, as well as the OASIS API, are public, the wallet can obtain this secret from Fastspot’s transaction or from the OASIS contract. Side-note for developers: Additionally to monitoring the respective blockchain or OASIS API on which the secret will be revealed, the wallet is also periodically checking the Fastspot API itself, where Fastspot reveals the secret once the contract is claimed on-chain, too. With the knowledge of the swap secret, the wallet can now claim your funds from the other contract. So let’s claim them! Step 5: Claim the incoming contract You already prepared the claiming transaction when you signed the funding transaction in the Keyguard. The swap secret is not part of the transaction data that is signed, so adding the secret into the transaction is still possible and does not invalidate it. Now that the transaction — called “settlement instruction” for OASIS — is complete, the wallet can broadcast it to the respective network. This immediately shows up in your transaction history as a pending incoming transaction, which means the swap is complete! Side-note for developers: Additionally to the wallet being on the lookout for the swap secret, Fastspot also offers a so-called “watchtower service”. This is a service that takes your pre-signed claiming transaction and monitors the swap progress. If it sees the secret, it will also broadcast your claiming transaction. This is a failover for when your wallet loses internet connection, your computer crashes, or you accidentally close the browser. However, it is important to remember that the watchtower is not a guarantee, but rather an additional safeguard to make sure that as many swaps as possible will be successful, which reduces the number of refunded swaps due to timeouts. Step 5b: Expired swaps and automatic refunds But what happens when the secret never gets published? Then the timelock part of the Hashed Timelock Contract comes into play: after a predefined time, in our case 1.5 hours, the contracts expire, and the funds are automatically sent back to the original owners. That applies for both contracts, so if for whatever reason Fastspot “forgets” to pick up its funds, the contracts will time out and you will get your part back. Neither can get lost. Side-note for devs: The contract that you are funding times out a little bit before the one that Fastspot creates. That way there is no possibility of Fastspot claiming your contract, but you not having enough time to claim the other one. Smart, eh? :) Conclusion What do you think? Do you now have a better understanding of the nitty-gritty that happens under the covers of Nimiq Wallet atomic swaps? Was it enlightening or rather frightening? Do you have more questions? Let us know on Twitter and Telegram, we are happy to extend this blog post with more details and clarifications! Until next time! Pura Vida! Sören & Sven]]></content:encoded>

This month, the Community Funding Board held it’s transition meeting with both the new and old community representatives in attendance to ensure a smooth handover between Boards. Here’s what went down. The Meeting During the meeting, both old and new Community representatives weighed in with thoughts and opinions to further improve the operation of the Community Funding Board. The following topics were discussed. Server Costs: Given that help with server costs are a common request from community developers, the Board had the idea of beginning a plan to implement a Community Managed Server Infrastructure Service to help support the further decentralization of community projects.The technicalities of this effort are yet to be discussed. Process Improvements: The Board discussed how to further expand the reach of the Board and Community Funding initiatives. It was agreed that communication channels with Board updates could be maintained better, updated more frequently and this would make it easier for the Nimiq community to be kept in the loop about the Board’s activities. The agreed-upon solution was to assign a task-leader to each communication channel, through which Community Funding Board information is distributed. This task-leader would ultimately be responsible for Board updates on their assigned channel and this covers channels like Twitter or the Nimiq forum. Open-Sourced, Close-Sourced & For-Profit Projects: Discussion focused on how important it was for new project proposals to be able to survive or be maintained without the leadership or efforts of the original creator. In short, it was agreed that any new funding proposals submitted to the Board, should be incentivized to include a mechanism that would enable the general Nimiq community to build upon or even take over the project at a later date. The key driving force behind this decision was to strengthen the shared vision that any project funded should strive towards the ideal of ‘for the community, by the community’. Incentivizing Open-Sourced Project Proposals: The Board discussed how proposal submissions are to be broken down into three different categories. 1. Open-source 2. Closed-source 3. For-Profit - Any type of project that can monetize and generate revenue for the creator. It was agreed that a higher reward could be applied to submitted proposals depending on what category the project falls into. Open-source projects attract the highest reward multiplier, followed by closed-source and for-profit. A final decision on these reward multipliers will be made in the coming few weeks. The Board also unanimously agreed that previously funded projects would not be forced to open source. Evaluated Funding Proposals This month, two community projects were assessed for funding. NIM Tip Bot Project purpose: Telegram tipping bot for NIM with simplicity and decentralization in mind. Development stage: Working product. Project team: Albermonte Previously evaluated? No  The Board commented on how the amount of NIM requested for airdrops seemed low and agreed to ask Albermonte if he wanted to increase the amount of airdrop NIM requested. It was agreed that server costs would be covered for two months until a Community Managed Server Infrastructure Service was set up to support projects like this. The Board also decided to allocate a reward of 500K to recognize the effort that goes into this project. This does not only include development but also the awesome support that Alberto provides in the community and also the huge value it provides to the community in terms of engagement. NIMNow Project purpose: NIMNow is a service where anyone can earn free NIM by doing online tasks like watching videos, getting involved in contests and much, much more. Development stage: Working product. Project team: Hextic Previously evaluated? No  After a lengthy discussion about the proposal, the Board decided that modifications were required in order to fund NIMNow. It was decided that HTTPS support was critical for the project and that this feature should be added to the proposal as a milestone. The discussion then turned to the features suggested and the opinion of the Board was that many of these milestones could be achieved with plugins or features of Titan script which could be easily installed. It was agreed that Hextic should be asked why he thought that the additional feature required a significant amount of work. After review of the NIMNow site, the Board believed that the platform could do with a UI/UX upgrade to make the service more usable. It was agreed that Team Nimiq should offer NIMNow help with this. Finally, given that NIMNow is a for-profit project and has ways to monetize through ads or driving traffic to select partners, the Board decided to ask Hextic to modify the proposal to add more details regarding the milestones while at the same time providing a revenue and expense plan for NIMNow’s operations to help the Board fund a fair portion of the project's operating costs. Reactive Rewards  Last but by no means least, the Board turned its attention to reactive community rewards. The following decisions were made: Everyone who put themselves forward as a candidate for the most recent Community Funding Board elections and didn’t get elected as a Community Representative is to be awarded 7777 NIM each.  Community member Destropx was also recognized for the survey questions he was frequently doing in the Nimiq Telegram group. The awesome thing is that he was constantly tipping people who respond to his excellent questions. The Board decided to grant 50K NIM to enable Destropx to keep doing what he’s doing in the NImiq Telegram group. The Board and Team Nimiq agreed to make the Community Funding Board more visible by showcasing the initiative on the homepage of Nimiq.com. It was agreed that this increased prominence of the program should lead to even more proposals being submitted.  In the next meeting, the Board will discuss rewards for all the Community Representatives finishing their current term. Chugwig will also be considered for a separate reward to recognize the development of the Nimiq voting app - which was key to holding Community Funding Board elections. Got A Great Idea That You Need Help Getting Off The Ground?  Do you have a great concept that could add value to the Nimiq ecosystem and just need a helping hand? The new Board would love to hear your ideas and proposals. Remember that the Community Funding Board is there to help you get started and get building. All you need to do is to read our proposal submission guide and shoot off an email to Proposals@Nimiq.com. The future is bright, the future is Nimiq. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recap 2019 was an eventful year for Nimiq. Albatross, Nimiq’s unique Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, took shape and its test-environment performance surpassed the team’s expectations. Nimiq OASIS successfully executed the first crypto-to-fiat atomic swap and, together with Matthias von Hauff’s TEN31 Bank, development is ongoing to empower the non-custodial buying and selling of crypto.  The new Nimiq Checkout was released, enhancing the payment system with an easy tool for merchants and webshop vendors to earn BTC and ETH alongside NIM.  The list goes on, but a recap cannot neglect the fact that NIM has remained under the radar during 2019. Despite the advances in product and protocol, public awareness and real-world adoption remain unsolved challenges. We recognize and share concerns voiced by the community and are committed to adopt positive changes.  To prove our commitment, team members mutually agreed to significant, additional cuts to their contracting compensations. Moreover the team was able to attract more talent, including Mathéo (Front-end Engineer), Max (Event & Biz Dev) and Bruno (Blockchain Engineer) joining the team. Additionally, all team members receive a portion of their compensation in NIM, accepting a rate currently 8x higher than the market value. Even external collaborators joined in on the effort and reduced their compensations as well.  Ultimately, our partners and we believe that we are contributing to something meaningful and we are convinced of Nimiq’s future success. The overall spirit at Nimiq is more positive than ever. We now are working on unique technology able to solve many of the challenges crypto is facing today: accessibility, usability, scalability and – for us still the most essential – simplicity.  For 2020, the team made a plan to finalize and ship the pending technologies as well as building them into ready-to-use products and to roll them in a physical location. So without further ado, here are the cornerstones of our 2020 vision. Let your NIM work for you  The switch to PoS will introduce fundamental improvements to the network’s performance and economics. The significance can be illustrated by our projection of energy consumption per transaction. Currently, a transaction at full network capacity requires the equivalent energy of ten AA batteries. With Albatross, it’s 1.5% of one AA battery.   Staking will not only lower energy consumption. With Nimiq, it will further lower the barriers for everyday people to receive rewards, while supporting the network. As we have proven with the account creation, we are now setting out to deliver the easiest and most accessible staking feature ever.   UI mock-up of the soon-to-be-released staking calculator. Leveraging Bitcoin From the very beginning, Nimiq aimed to deliver a more accessible, more user-friendly version of Bitcoin technology suitable for everyday people and payments.  We are close to the point where we can provide a payment system that lives up to this aspiration: Decentralized and non-custodial payments, almost instantaneous and accessible to everyone. Still, we believe in Bitcoin as a store of value and want to support it within our ecosystem.  Going forward, we will integrate Bitcoin in new Nimiq products. Bitcoin and NIM don’t compete – they complete each other: While Bitcoin is the established store of value, NIM is the convenient and fast way to pay – while getting staking rewards along the way – both coins have clear roles. This “Trojan Horse” strategy presents several advantages and opportunities. We can leverage BTC to address the wider crypto community with Nimiq's innovations (easy-to-use Login Files, buying and selling for Fiat via OASIS etc.). Irrespectively this will contribute to and strengthen crypto in general – something that genuinely matters to us.  By supporting Bitcoin, we become a relevant choice for beginners who are primarily interested in BTC.  This way, Nimiq’s strengths become visible to a broader audience.  We strive to deliver a single solution for buying, holding and transacting NIM and BTC that is decentralized, requires no personal data and is easy to use.  Converting these new Bitcoin-friendly users to try out NIM will be facilitated by a persuasive UX and NIM’s obvious advantages in performance and usability. Staking, and thus getting passive rewards, will be a compelling argument for NIM as well.  New wallet, new mobile app To accommodate all these new features, we will enhance the current browser experience by introducing an entirely new Nimiq Safe Wallet. This redesign will ultimately streamline the interfaces across the entire user experience on all devices, including mobile. But we are not stopping there. A long-term wish of the community and the team will be fulfilled this year. We are building a mobile app that will combine the features of Nimiq in a single product.  This app will feature  NIM and BTC in one account (one Login File, one password) Complete wallet functionality, elegantly designed Non-custodial buying and selling of NIM and BTC Easy NIM staking … making it the most essential, decentralized cryptocurrency wallet to date.  The user experience on mobiles will be significantly increased by leveraging native functionality like fingerprint sensors and integrating Hub and Keyguard. Security will be further enhanced while simplifying accessibility. Additionally, the mobile app will be a product that is easier to grasp and to market. A mobile app – always visible and available on a user’s home screen – conveys an enhanced feeling of ownership, custody and security.   Concept and design work has already started, development will begin at the end of January. Don't buy Crypto, earn it!  As Andreas Antonopoulos proclaimed: ‘Don't buy Bitcoin, EARN it’. We, too, believe there is a huge opportunity in addressing the large community of freelancers and individual business owners who are interested in crypto. But for many, getting a wallet and buying over an exchange comes with complexity, privacy matters and an effort that is often overwhelming.   We are releasing cryptopayment.link, a free web service that will empower anyone to create P2P payment requests in crypto and receive notifications when they are fulfilled. The seller can – without registration or installation – visit the website and create a unique link by entering the desired fiat amount, a description and a BTC, ETH or NIM address.  This link can be conveniently included in invoices, sent as a message or be printed as a QR code. The buyer simply opens the link, is provided with easy instructions to pay the market rate amount due in crypto. With this, we provide an easy tool for anyone, anywhere to take advantage of the promotional effect of expanding their audience to crypto-paying customers, as well as earn their first crypto.  Generate revenue to grow the Nimiq community While we are working on solutions that we hope will benefit the entire crypto sphere, we have identified and – in part – already implemented solutions that hold great potential for monetization.  OASIS is such an example. All transactions executed via TEN31 Bank are expected to generate direct and indirect revenue for Nimiq, a shareholder of TEN31 and enabler of the service. A new essential building block to facilitate OASIS powered transactions is the Fiat Atomic Swap Trader (FAST). FAST is a market maker created by Nimiq, that will not only empower OASIS with instant liquidity as needed, but may also be integrated with third parties, like DEXs.  We will provide more info on these developments in time. For now, we want to point out that Team Nimiq will use all earnings resulting from these efforts to fund and promote the Nimiq project – nothing else.  Answering “But what can I do with it?”  Crypto in general — and an upcoming coin like Nimiq especially — is faced with the reasonable question of where and what it can actually be used for.  Several projects have kicked off efforts to establish and integrate themselves in economically challenged communities and crisis riddled regions. While we have nothing but respect for each and every one of these efforts, we believe that it’s too early to expect significant adoption to be achieved this way in a relatively short time-horizon. Although we are confident that it’s only a matter of time before crypto takes off in economically challenged communities and beyond, we believe that dedicating a significant proportion of the project’s resources to such an effort is unwise at this stage.  Considering this, we will continue innovating and developing, to be ready once the necessity and value of a decentralized payment system are globally recognized.   Does this mean we won’t promote Nimiq’s usage? Quite the opposite: Nimiq was born in a small beach town (Santa Teresa) in Costa Rica. The town mainly consists of a small road parallel to the beach with a few thousand locals and tens of thousands of traveling visitors throughout the year. Formerly a fishing village, its sheer natural beauty, healthy lifestyle and pristine beaches have made it a 5-star travel destination, attracting an influential, well-situated and international crowd.   With native Costa Ricans and long-term residents on the team, we managed to establish excellent connections with local merchants and businesses. And while the rest of the world will have to wait, we plan on introducing Nimiq as a means of earning crypto and as payment method throughout the local surf shops, bars and hotels. This way, we will get: A confined but real environment, allowing us to test and improve our products continuously and with a tight feedback loop More transactions on the network increasing trading volume, resulting in: Income for the project by funnelling conversions through OASIS and FAST A strong answer to the question of what NIM can be used for Most importantly, we want to leverage the continuous influx of influential people with disposable income. With Instagram influencers, private investors and executives visiting the picturesque destination, we can put Nimiq in the hands of this valuable target audience.  This year, we look to establish a strong presence in this area, creating a resource-saving growth hack, improving our products and giving every holder an amazing way to actually spend their NIM and BTC – all by visiting this place in paradise.   Let’s get started! We will provide more in-depth information on the various aspects laid out in this blog post in time. For now, we wanted to share the highlights for this year as we feel genuinely excited about them and what the future holds for Nimiq. Until then,  Go Nimiq! And Pura Vida!]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The Nimiq Community Funding Board elections are open for voting!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We're inviting you, as a valued member of the Nimiq community, to vote for a community representative in our Community Funding Board elections. Elections are open as of today and will close Tuesday 26th. This is a great opportunity to get your voice heard and to help shape the future of our community's ecosystem! Make sure to head to the Nimiq Voting App and cast your vote! There are seven candidates for the current Community Funding Board elections. From these seven candidates, three will be elected; and these three will help to decide on funding proposals by community projects that apply to the Community Funding Board. Meet the Candidates You can find all candidates in the dedicated section of the Nimiq Community Forum. But we'd like to give the candidates (in no particular order) the chance to briefly introduce themselves to you here: Paul Gertz Hi there Nimiq community!  I’m Paul, 35 years old, I’m a web developer living in the south of France. I discovered Nimiq at the end of 2019 with the help of Google. That was also actually my first “deep” dive into crypto! I’ve discovered a great community, nice tools and softwares. I quickly wanted to participate, in any way I could. You may have seen a t-shirt design I’ve made on the Nimiq Shop. I’m sure you’ve played Nimtris. I approached Stefan proposing to change the color set of the tiles, and he kindly offered me my first merged Pull request ever. I’ve opened the Nimiq Game Store where you can buy Steam Games at great discounted prices (it is so easy to implement a payment solution with Nimiq, I couldn’t resist). I’ve also developed Nimiq Vouchers where you can (usually) buy vouchers and gift cards with Nimiq. The website is at the moment unfortunately undergoing technical maintenance.  Currently working on a(some?) new project(s?) for the Nimiq community, I hope to share more info later this year! Nothing crazy, just illustrating ways to interact/play with the blockchain, thanks to Nimiq ease of use. FonsL My name is Fons, I am 31 years young. And I live in the Netherlands. In 2016 I became active in crypto and in particular Bitcoin. Besides Bitcoin, I also read a dozen or so whitepapers from other altcoins – in which many promises were not fulfilled. When I started to delve into Nimiq I found out how transparent it is, and what a strong vision they had for the future. This is something I didn’t see in the other projects I was observing. Since 2017/2018 I started designing for different crypto projects as a volunteer/hobby, infographics in particular. I like to translate difficult matters into something easier to understand. At the moment I design a lot for TEN31, which is really fun to do. Together with Albermonte I’m working on a mini game for Nimiq, called ‘‘Nimiq Treasury’’. Jonathan I’m from the US and work in Information Security. I got into the crypto space back in 2020, researched a lot about blockchain tech during that time and never looked back. I stumbled across Nimiq during this period and it is one of the few projects to truly pique my interest. I’ve been mostly active on reddit and telegram trying to educate others about Nimiq and blockchain tech. Whenever I see a potential idea or partnership, I try my best to relay it to the community and the team to see if it can improve Nimiq as a whole. I’m always on the lookout for new ideas or tech. Albermonte Hello, I’m Albermonte, I’m a 25-year-old developer living in Spain. I’ve been developing apps using the Nimiq tech since 2018, some of them are:  ShortNIM NIM Pools Hub: Web, Miner and Android app NIM Tip Bot Nimiq Multi Cashlink Nimiq Sunset Cyberspace I’m currently working with FonsL on a new mini game called “Nimiq Treasury”, which will hopefully be available to play before the end of the year. The game is almost playable but needs to be polished a little bit more. I will continue to develop Nimiq applications and learn more and more about cutting edge technology and blockchain and apply this to new applications and games. Stefan Hi everybody, it’s Stefan here from the Nimiq community. I first set foot into this community around July 2017.  Many of you probably know me because of certain projects I did like Nimtris, Twini, the Nimiq RPC Client for Rust or generally chatting on the different social platforms. My background is tech-focused and I think this will be a valuable addition to the next board round. I’m also the Dutch Local Community Manager and support people if they have questions or inquiries of any kind. Faberto My Name is Tobi (Faberto). I'm a developer with a background in cybersecurity. I was introduced to Nimiq by one of the founders back in 2017. This was the starting point for me to get into blockchain technology. I immediately started building applications for the first testnet, starting with a mining pool to fully understand how the chain works. Shortly after the launch of the mainnet I also operated a public pool which ran very well. Until today the pool's seed node still runs as a community node.  For Albatross I am already working on a staking service to get everyone started with running their own validators: Validator as a Service. Sometimes I just play around with the chain for fun: Nimiq Smart Hoodie - YouTube.  As part of the CFB I can contribute my technical knowledge and experience in building projects. I do favor technically useful proposals but “fun” projects are helpful for the community as well!  Michael My name is Michael, but most people know me by my user name: Coin Revolution or Nimiq Maniac. Two years ago I found Nimiq through friends and since then I am fascinated by the unique technology and our great community. Since January 2021 I am a permanent member of the Nimiq Squad and in the summer of 2021 I was given the honor of being one of the Team Leaders. We are working every day to make the Nimiq Squad even more effective and successful to reach more people and bring them closer to Nimiq.  How can you participate in the elections? The steps are simple for you to participate in the election: 1- Visit nimiq.com/vote 2- Sort the candidates in the order you prefer  3- Click “Vote” 4- You will be redirected to the Nimiq Wallet where you will be able to vote with your Nimiq account you select.   5- Just sign the transactions like you would do with any regular transaction by using your password or Ledger Hardware Wallet.  We also prepared a full tutorial which can be found here.  IMPORTANT: You can NOT vote with funds held in exchanges or third party wallets, because they don’t support custom public messages in transactions, which are needed for the vote to be recorded on the blockchain. You can also not vote with funds in vesting contracts (please move available funds to a regular account address first). Your vote will be submitted through the Nimiq Voting app by sending 1 Luna (= 0.00001 NIM) to the preset burn address (an address that will be calculated by the voting app based on the hash of the voting setup. This makes it verifiable that the setup is not changed during or after voting). The transaction contains the vote in the form of a public message recorded on the blockchain. What counts is the balance (1 NIM = 1 Vote) on your voting address AT THE CLOSING OF THE VOTE WHEN A SNAPSHOT OF THE BLOCKCHAIN IS TAKEN AT THE FINAL BLOCK. Example: if you submit a vote and then move the funds away from that address before the end of the voting period, the balance on that address will be zero, equivalent to no votes. Note that of course you can vote again with your new address that now has the balance. This prevents anyone from using their balance(s) more than once. You can change your vote by voting again with the same address.Only the last vote of an address counts, at the end of the voting period, with the balance it has at that time. Do not wait until the last minute to submit your vote. Things always take longer than expected and this way you can also correct your vote by re-submitting it – in case you made a mistake or changed your mind. What happens after the elections? Once the elections are completed, the 3 winners of the election will be announced. From then on, for at least 6 months and together with 3 members of our team, they will comprise the Community Funding Board, which meets every 1-2 months to vote on the applications for funding. We would like to extend a special thank you to those of you who took the time to cast their vote and make their voice heard. Thank you for your continued support! Pura Vida

            <description><![CDATA[Updates on progress, recent achievements, and upcoming tasks]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month we published the first Progress Report. As things keep on progressing quickly, we want to share with you another progress report on our upcoming goals, latest achievements, and recent priority changes. Team Structure If you are not familiar with the members of Team Nimiq, here is a quick summary of the team structure (leaving out legal and operations): Core (Blockchain Development & Research): Janosch, Jeff, Marvin, Pascal, Philipp, Richard. Front-end (UI/UX, Apps, Website): Daniel, Julian, Matheó, Tammo, Sebastian, Sören, Sven. Communication (Marketing, Content Creation, Social Media): Atua, Chris, Julian, Richy, Sven, Sui-Ju, Tammo. Upcoming Goals Core Albatross DevNet: squashing bugs, improving performance. Researching on potential optimizations for Nimiq 2.0 Stabilization and testing of the Albatross demonstrator Front-end Continue stabilizing Cashlinks and Multi-Currency features: code reviews and merging into main code base Prototyping a service for merchants to conveniently create crypto invoices and send a link to customers to pay — more details soon! RFCs for the Hub Checkout API and Nimiq ID to present our ideas and collect feedback from the community Design and planning of Nimiq OASIS microsite Christmas Cashlink gift card creator Communication Sales outreach to WooCommerce stores: Let us know if you run a WordPress web shop or if you know someone that has one! Ramping up Nimiq’s presence on LinkedIn: make sure you follow us! Preparing explanatory video for Nimiq OASIS Outreach to influencers and crypto authorities for further reviews, interviews, and AMAs: Let us know if you are interested in interviewing us! Priority Changes UTXOTree moved to Q2 2020 As announced in the recent updates to the Nimiq Whitepaper, we have come up with a new approach to store account balances. We are calling it the UTXOTree because it is a hybrid model between UTXO-based transactions and an Accounts Tree. In this novel data structure, the Accounts Tree provides easy access to all unspent transactions of an address thus giving all the benefits of an accounts-based model — e.g., provable account statements — while combining it with the power of UTXOs — e.g. having multiple in- and outputs per transaction. Additionally, the validity start height in transactions — required in Nimiq 1.0 — can be omitted, which simplifies the protocol and improves the network’s usability. The UTXOTree is a rather technical upgrade to the Nimiq accounts data structure. On the other hand, Albatross already links together several dependencies like the calculation of a new supply curve, the new micro/macro block structure and last but not least the switch to Proof-of-Stake. After discussions during the previous month, our Core Team has therefore decided to finish all the tasks related to the implementation of the Albatross consensus algorithm first. This will allow the community to get the first impression of Albatross and Nimiq 2.0 quicker while still leaving room for future planned upgrades including the switch to UTXOTree. NimiqID moved to 2020 The Nimiq ecosystem is browser-first, which makes it easy to use on the web. We have been discussing for a while now with members from the community about the creation of a Nimiq-based solution for authentication that takes advantage of the superior usability and design of the Nimiq ecosystem. A solution that takes advantage of Nimiq’s cryptography and also substitutes the infamous “Login with Google/Facebook” button sounds very sexy indeed, and that is why we are very excited about it. It is worth noting that such a solution would not use the Nimiq Blockchain, but use Nimiq’s public-key-cryptography and the Nimiq Hub to prove the users’ identity to web apps. Also important to consider is the fact that other crypto-based solutions like Digi-ID already exist. Such solutions seem to struggle in gaining momentum because one of the main reasons developers integrate “Login with Google/Facebook” is to take advantage of the existing information from the user that is stored by those social media platforms. Nimiq’s Front-end team is eager to work on NimiqID, but since Nimiq does not store any personal information, NimiqID is unlikely to be a game-changer at this time. Thus, we decided to focus on our core technology for now. Given that Nimiq is working on actual game-changing technology, namely Albatross and OASIS, we need to allocate Front-end resources to support those efforts. Starting with the Albatross DevNet, our Front-end team will be focusing on improving current apps and creating new ones for the first flight of the Albatross, planned for next year. With the introduction of staking, new possibilities arise. What’s more, with Nimiq introducing user-friendly staking features the Front-end and UI/UX design teams have the potential to create the most intuitive and convenient staking that the crypto world has seen.  Recent Achievements Firsts Tests of Nimiq OASIS Nimiq OASIS is a technology invented by the developers of Team Nimiq to allow the creation of off-chain HTLC. This technology will be used to execute off-chain atomic swaps like fiat/fiat, fiat/crypto, and other tradable assets. We are excited to tell you that the first tests of Nimiq OASIS have been successful. We believe OASIS has huge potential to bring to the entire crypto space and we couldn't be more excited!  We will keep working on Nimiq OASIS itself and are also building a new product powered by Nimiq OASIS. Remember to follow us on Twitter to be the first to get information on new developments. Albatross DevNet The first glimpse of Albatross is almost ready to go live, and it is… fast!There is definitely a feeling of nostalgia that might remind long-term supporters of the early days of the BetaNet. You have probably noticed Core developer Janosch tweeting about how fast Albatross is. However, the launch of the first demo of Albatross required the involvement of almost the entire team. Given the performance of Albatross, we are excited about it finally spreading its wings and increasing the visibility of Nimiq in the crypto space.  We will soon release an Albatross demonstrator to be used as a key piece of our marketing efforts moving forward. We are looking forward to hearing your thoughts, questions, and suggestions! Nimiq Multi-Currency Checkout and Kindhumans After an initial announcement of Kindhumans using Nimiq’s blockchain to record an immutable fingerprint of their transparency reports, Nimiq kept on exploring possible ways to collaborate with Kindhumans. After all, Kindhumans is an online store with huge growth potential sharing the ethical charity-driven mentality of Team Nimiq. We thank the Kindhumans Team for joining us on our journey of creating and testing the first Cryptocurrency Checkout that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Nimiq without the need for personal information or a middleman. It was an amazing effort by the Front-end Team providing Nimiq’s Community with a great tool that can be integrated into any e-commerce store.   TEN31 visits Nimiq and answers questions from the community Matthias von Hauff, CEO of TEN31 Bank visited Nimiq in the jungle and we used this opportunity to give the Nimiq Community the chance to ask questions about our partnership using the new format from TEN31: Ten questions, thirty-one seconds per question. You can watch the interview here  Nimiq Rust Client Release Candidate tests Last last month we released the Rust implementation to the Nimiq Community, which started to test it up to the point of running a Nimiq Node on an Android mobile! We have also been testing the new Rust client in the Nimiq Seed Nodes with good results. After some more testing we plan to release the first stable version of the Nimiq Rust Client. Nimiq Cryptocurrency Checkout Plugin for WordPress updated Our WooCommerce plugin has been updated to integrate with the Multi-Currency Checkout. For the first time, WordPress stores can accept BTC, ETH, and NIM without a middleman. We are very excited about this contribution to the crypto space. Most other plugins in WordPress require you to pay, have a monthly transaction limit or require personal information and usually take custody of your funds. You are relying on others keeping their promises. Finally, there is an anonymous and easy way to accept the major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Nimiq! :)  Nimiq "plants" 3458 trees Nimiq joined YouTuber Mr Beast in his efforts to plant 20 Million Trees by adding the option to donate a tree in the Nimiq Shop. To further support this effort, we started a campaign in which the Nimiq Foundation donates a second tree for every tree donated by the Nimiq Community. We would like to thank all the Nimiq supporters who helped us make our world greener.  Nimiq Community Bounty Program As mentioned in the last Community Funding Meeting Report, the Nimiq Community Board has discussed ways of proposing projects to the community encouraging technical and non-technical contributions. One of the ideas being discussed is the Nimiq Community Bounty Program. The main goal of this effort is to allow the community to be part of the project by contributing and helping the Nimiq Ecosystem grow. The entire team is at the disposal of the brave contributors to help and guide them.  Richy (Community Manager) and Sven (Technical Documentation) joined forces with our Front-end and Core Teams to collect ideas that can be used in this program. We are looking for projects that are fun to build yet challenging, have a positive impact in the community, and that can be easily mentored by Team Nimiq. Projects of the Community Bounty Program will be announced over Nimiq’s social media channels, shared publicly in the Nimiq Forum and will soon be added to our website. If you have more ideas for projects, please reach out to the Community Board representatives: Chugwig, Wekkel, Tomkha, Sven, Marvin, and Richy. We at Team Nimiq are very excited about the potential of Albatross and will continue working on increasing the awareness of the project. You can help support Nimiq and all of our efforts by interacting with us on Twitter and YouTube, and don’t forget to tell your friends! Pura Vida! Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[BTC, ETH, and NIM Cryptocurrency Adoption Through Sustainability]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Kindhumans is a marketplace for ethical products guided by the principle of delivering a more responsible, mindful, and holistic consumer platform. This positive, transparent and eco-friendly mindset resonates strongly with Nimiq’s spirit. As announced before, the two projects have been contributing to record the hash of Kindhuman’s published reports on the Nimiq Blockchain so that the public can verify the genuine, untampered nature of each report. We are happy to announce that this collaboration has grown to include the new Nimiq Checkout for Crypto in Kindhuman’s online shop! The vital role of social awareness There is no denying that the newer generation gives considerably more importance to eco-awareness, sustainability, and overall human kindness towards each other and our earth. This same generation is also likely to take the lead in crypto adoption in the years to come.  Sustainability in the cryptocurrency space is probably not an obvious necessity at first glance but will come to play a significant role. Something all Nimiq Team Members have in common is that fairness and kindness guide their moral compass. This can easily be noticed in the way the project behaves as a whole. Initial charity allocation: Since the beginning of the project, Team Nimiq has shared its interest in good causes and sustainability, to the extent of allocating 2% of total NIM supply to its charity (ImpactX Foundation). These funds will be aimed at projects of high ecological and social impact and are time-locked in a vesting contract that limits rushed dispensation. Nimiq 2.0 and switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS): One of the strong reasons for the transition to PoS with Nimiq 2.0 is the enormous electricity consumption of PoW Blockchains. The decrease in energy consumption by switching to PoS will be dramatic. In addition, Nimiq's novel PoS implementation also breaks technological ground due to its extraordinary transaction throughput approaching the theoretical limit for single chain blockchain protocols, all without compromising on decentralization and censorship resistance.  Nimiq #TeamTrees Campaign: Running during November 2019, this campaign supports the effort of MrBeast in planting 20 Million Trees. Team Nimiq has added a “Tree Item” to the Nimiq Shop with which you can donate a tree using the NIM equivalent of less than a Dollar. The best part is not only the easy and smooth payment, but also that Nimiq is supporting #TeamTrees by donating an extra tree for each tree donated in the shop. Bringing cryptocurrency to the masses To reach mass-adoption of cryptocurrency, crypto payments need to be conveniently available for all audiences, especially the next generation of eco- and crypto-friendly Millennials. Kindhumans is embracing this mindful movement and in extension of our existing partnership, we have worked to integrate a brand new Nimiq Checkout for Crypto in the Kindhumans online shop. This enables Kindhumans to accept cryptocurrency payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum and of course, Nimiq.  Comparing the payment experience with NIM to ETH and BTC, a few differences are noteworthy: Nimiq has low fees: Scalability of the Nimiq Network keeps the Blockchain decongested. The transactions per second are due to increase from 7 to 1000+ with the transition to Nimiq 2.0.  Nimiq shines in the Checkout: Thanks to Nimiq’s blockchain code being native to the web, the Nimiq Checkout experience for NIM is all in-browser and exceptionally quick, smooth and easy. It just takes a couple of clicks and your Account password to pay for your rewarding Kindhumans products. Nimiq confirmations are fast: When compared to BTC, Nimiq transactions get confirmed 10x faster. This will further improve with the transition to Nimiq 2.0 where transactions are expected to be confirmed in as little as 2-3 seconds. A place for the ethical crypto consumer The number of cryptocurrency wallets is growing exponentially, demonstrating that more people every day are developing a real interest. Kindhumans is providing mindful products to the world through online purchases and has made a conscious choice to support progressive forms of payment such as cryptocurrency. At Nimiq we are proud and humbled to be working with Kindhumans to now also fulfill the cryptocurrency part of the blockchain equation. We aim to support Kindhumans as marketplace for sustainable products by providing any holders of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Nimiq with an easy to use checkout experience at kindhumans.com - try it out now! Thank you Kindhumans team for choosing us to make this happen! Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[An update on the recent progress of Nimiq 2.0]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Team Nimiq is working on upgrading the Nimiq blockchain from the current 1.0 version to the new 2.0 version. While Nimiq 1.0 uses a proof-of-work consensus algorithm, Nimiq 2.0 will switch to our Albatross proof-of-stake algorithm and thus require magnitudes less electricity. While Nimiq 1.0 has a throughput of 15 tx/s, Nimiq 2.0 will be able to process more than 1000 on-chain tx/s. At the same time Nimiq will continue to enable browser applications to be nodes in the blockchain network and to provide a great user-experience. The state of Nimiq 2.0 is progressing on multiple fronts. Work is being done on the Nimiq 2.0 nodes themselves, on the hard fork mechanism and on staking-related user interfaces. Blockchain nodes A lot of time went into debugging and testing the Nimiq 2.0 full node. At this point, the node runs stable in a controlled lab environment. That means it establishes and maintains consensus, produces and validates blocks and maintains a network of peers to exchange data with. We shared a tutorial on how to setup a lab environment and are happy to see that community members are already testing the nodes and are reporting their findings. The next step is to test the node in further scenarios: Unreliable network conditions, conflicting chains, malicious actors and much more. To this end we'll follow two approaches: First, we'll manually create different scenarios to test edge-cases. Secondly, we will setup an internal Devnet that will automatically simulate everyday usage: validators being added or removed, transactions, stake changes, different network delays and so on. After we verified that the node runs stable in various scenarios, we will start the public Aurora Testnet. Apart from debugging, larger changes to the staking contract are also in progress. The staking contract contains information about validators and stakers. It is a type of account and as such it is contained in the accounts tree. Currently the staking contract is a leaf in the accounts tree, but we are changing it to be a subtree structure. The subtree structure will allow to efficiently query and prove which validators an account stakes with. This will allow browser nano nodes to quickly obtain and display staking information, for example in the wallet. The current changes will also allow staking contract information to be loaded into memory only as they are needed. Hard fork mechanism Since Nimiq 2.0 will have a completely different consensus algorithm than Nimiq 1.0, the upgrade requires to stop the Nimiq 1.0 blockchain and then start the Nimiq 2.0 blockchain. We previously detailed the hard fork mechanism in a blog post. The genesis block of the Nimiq 2.0 chain will contain the last state of the Nimiq 1.0 chain. The blockchain state for example includes the accounts tree, which stores the balances of each account.  We recently created a tool that exports the current blockchain state from the database of a Nimiq 1.0 node. A second recently finished tool takes the exported data and creates a genesis block for the Nimiq 2.0 chain from it. The genesis block generated by these tools will be broadcasted into the network. That means Nimiq 2.0 nodes will initially not have a preconfigured genesis block but will only receive it after being connected to the network for a while. Consequently, we started to adjust the Nimiq 2.0 client to receive the genesis block from the network. Staking user interfaces Planning of the staking interfaces started early this year. The interface drafts received multiple internal iterations. After that we put together a design prototype and presented it to the community to gather additional feedback. While smaller changes to the designs might still happen, we already started implementing the designs in the wallet using a mock backend. With OASIS released three weeks ago, we can now direct some additional workforce towards Nimiq 2.0. The current top priority is to get everything ready for the public Aurora Testnet and thus start a bigger "real world" test. We love how involved the Nimiq community has been so far and hope you'll join us in further Nimiq 2.0 blockchain tests as well!  Pura vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq Wallet Now Supports USDC! 
We are integrating Polygon USDC into our payment ecosystem, marking a significant miles]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Team Nimiq is proud to announce the integration of USDC on Polygon into the Nimiq Wallet and payment ecosystem. This is the second currency addition to the Nimiq Wallet, and marks a significant milestone towards our vision for the future of payments. The successful integration of the USDC stablecoin is the result of an ambitious work sprint in which we also revamped the wallet’s UX and UI to further our ambition of providing a seamless payments experience for users. Open your wallet now and activate the update!  A long time coming The concept of incorporating a stablecoin had been under consideration for some time. The community and team engaged in lively discussions on the matter, including technical feasibility checks on "wrapped NIM", consultations on legal implications, and fundamental debates on the potential impact of this technical integration on the non-stable NIM. Recent developments and insights have culminated in a decision. One such insight was provided by Chainalysis’s recently published Crypto Adoption Index, summarizing the current state of crypto usage around the world. It concludes: Crypto is used the most in emerging markets, and the majority of transactions are done on stablecoins. Cryptocurrencies continue to thrive where there are true use cases, even despite bans, for example in China. Fundamentals of crypto regarding self-custody, censorship resistance, decentralization and neutrality are the main drivers for crypto adoption. “… users in lower middle and upper middle income countries often rely on cryptocurrency to send remittances, preserve their savings in times of fiat currency volatility, and fulfill other financial needs unique to their economies. These countries also tend to lean on Bitcoin and stablecoins more than other countries.” Meeting users where they are While we believe in the merit of such reports, it ultimately was the feedback of the merchants using our payment tools that made clear: Without the option to avoid volatility, accepting crypto payments and holding crypto on the balance sheet is too big of a risk for small businesses operating on thin margins. Providing a crypotcurrency similar to the known FIAT money not only substantially lowers the barrier to entry, it also increases the chance of continuous usage (aka adoption). So in order to really popularize crypto, we believe it is necessary to meet people where they are. Stablecoins act as a gateway, bridging the gap between the two worlds and paving the way to eventually move on to a cryptocurrency fully de-pegged from fiat, like NIM.  Why USDC? With a constant focus on user-friendliness and convenience, we have made the decision to introduce a stablecoin that offers the same level of familiarity as modern conventional payments, along with all the essential advantages of self-custody. After considering various options, we selected USDC for its exceptional reputation, strong support, and excellent infrastructure. USDC operates on multiple blockchains, with Ethereum and Polygon being the most widely recognized and respected. Why Polygon USDC? While the Ethereum-based stablecoin is currently the most widely used, Polygon (a second layer chain on top of Ethereum) offers significantly greater performance in terms of speed and transaction costs – crucial characteristics when aiming for everyday payments. Still, the need to hold and spend MATIC (Polygon’s native token) to transfer USDC threatens to jeopardize the idea of easy and effortless stablecoin usage. A technical challenge Nimiq Engineers were able to solve using a project called Ethereum Gas Station Network (GSN). It enables so called “gas payment abstraction” effectively freeing the user from having to worry about paying for gas – GSN does it for them. This functionality was extended to the Polygon Network by doing some clever smart contract coding. To avoid overloading this article with information, we will provide more details on this topic in a forthcoming technical blog post. For the Wallet, it simply means: All the Polygon USDC goodness without the need for MATIC. A step towards a greater vision With support for a total of three cryptocurrencies, some may assume that our wallet is on the path to becoming a multi-currency wallet.  But, we have a different vision in mind. There are already countless multi-currency wallets available, each with its own unique design and purpose, but all aimed at accommodating a wide variety of coins. If we assume that most crypto holders are motivated by investment opportunities, then diversifying one's portfolio by holding new coins as they emerge makes perfect sense. This is why many people prefer to use a single service that can handle multiple currencies for the sake of convenience. However, at Nimiq, we have never been too concerned with following the market trends. Entering the oversaturated market of multi-currency wallets is neither a promising nor a contributory pursuit towards Nimiq's goal of promoting widespread crypto adoption.  Depending on your perspective, situation and needs, you can decide to distribute your value across currencies with various qualities and capabilities. Fast and convenient like cash, slow and steady like gold, stable like bad old FIAT or volatile and fast-paced like crypto. By adding USDC to the Wallet, we are now able to offer what we’re calling, “The Trinity”: BTC: Store of Value USDC: Trusted stablecoin NIM: High-performance payment coin Ultimately, the Nimiq Wallet should support every major currency quality and capability that you might desire. What’s new? Here are the changes to the wallet: USDC available You can hold, receive and send Polygon USDC. And of course, you can swap USDC for NIM and BTC using SuperSimpleSwap. Simplified onboarding The account creation was substantially streamlined. The Identicon for the first address will be auto-assigned. Effectively, a new user sets a password and downloads the Login File – that’s it. No more Identicon names The auto-created Identicon names were always quite bulky and confused especially new users. We’re ending this feature and have implemented a more straightforward way of naming the addresses: They are named after the Identicon’s background color, which also connects to the naming convention of the accounts (blue background = “Blue address”). Greater emphasis on swaps and asset-mobility As a first expression of our new Wallet vision, atomic-swapping assets is now more accessible from the dashboard, illustrating how easy it is and encouraging a more fluid way of looking at these assets. The bar indicating the allocation of assets was a nice concept but proved difficult to read and use. We now feature a ring chart in the sidebar that reduces clutter in the main interaction area and provides more straightforward info on asset allocation.  Overhauled Network map Originally, the ‘Network’ view only showed the Nimiq Network. Now, BTC and USDC were added providing some base stats on all networks. We decided to keep the info rather light and exclusively show stats that don’t require crypto knowledge (what’s block height?) and provide value to the users, e.g. the current transaction costs. Please have a look and tell us what you think! On towards adoption Nimiq's Core Team has been making excellent progress, frequently sharing updates on their latest Proof-of-Stake developments. However, much of the team's efforts, not related to the protocol, are focused on building infrastructure and providing access points. The USDC integration is an addition to the adoption-focused tech and products released by Team Nimiq. Here is a quick summary of the latest initiatives: Cryptopayment.link An easy and free way to create invoices and get paid in crypto in true peer-to-peer fashion. The basic MVP service was dramatically improved last year with a merchant dashboard, export features for bookkeeping, options to charge on the spot or send an invoice plus an ‘accept-only’ feature for employees.  map.nimiq.com Released just this January, the crypto map gives more visibility to merchants accepting crypto. We consider this a general contribution to crypto that should not be limited to NIM acceptance. Read more in the blog article and help the map (and crypto in general) grow by adding places!  Cryptocity Further fostering and supporting crypto adoption, Team Nimiq developed a framework to help communities unite their adoption efforts. “Cryptocity“ is designed as an umbrella initiative that can be localized to represent any place eager to adopt. Last tweaks are being made but behind the curtains, the setup of the first Cryptocity is in full swing with partners and merchants being added on a daily basis. More on this very, very soon.  Wrapping up We are fully committed to NIM becoming the world’s leading decentralized form of payment. We see the addition of USDC to our Wallet and atomic swaps as an important step towards that vision. As always we thank you for joining us on this journey and would love to hear your opinions, so let us know what you think on Twitter. Pura Vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[More than ever, we are committed to growing the Nimiq ecosystem with quality collaborations that make it easier for more users to be part of Nimiq. This means increasing the ways in which people can get access to NIM. And it's for this reason too that we are excited to share great news with you: listing of NIM on one of the leading exchanges worldwide: Gate.io! About Gate.io  Founded in 2013, Gate.io is one of the most seasoned and well established cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. As recently shared, according to data from CoinGecko Gate.io has grown into one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volume. Gate.io also reports over 10 million registered users across the world, and has been verified by the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI). Besides the main exchange, Gate.io also offers other services such as decentralized finance, research and analytics, venture capital investments, wallet services and more.  Max Burger, Nimiq’s project ambassador: “We are very happy to be able to introduce Nimiq and NIM to Gate.io’s global community. Collaborating with a top-tier exchange like Gate.io not only means that we’re continuing our strategy to work with high-quality leaders in the crypto sector, it also means that Nimiq is strengthening its presence within Asian crypto communities. We look forward to working with Gate.io and welcoming new members to our vibrant social media communities!” Winter time is building time  If you're reading this you are probably well aware that crypto is currently in what is known as a “Bear Market” or Crypto Winter - which might lead you to question whether this is really the best time for an exchange listing. We think, on the other hand, that it's advantageous timing: why?  A main concern when it comes to evaluating new exchange listings for NIM is the planned upgrade to Nimiq Proof-of-Stake. As many of you know, we have long refrained from pursuing new listings before we had a clear roadmap towards the release of Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Mainnet. But now that we have an almost feature-complete Devnet which will soon evolve into the Testnet, we feel confident enough to talk to new exchange partners who have agreed to support this upgrade when the time comes. Ready for the next leap! Everyone who follows our project already knows that we always strive to work with leading partners in the industry. Our new partnership with Gate.io is another important building block in this strategy and will help Nimiq to forge even more top-class partnerships, while working towards positioning Nimiq among the TOP crypto projects worldwide.  Go Nimiq!]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[We are adding two major features to SuperSimpleSwap.com: referral links allowing you to earn rewards when your friends o]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[SuperSimpleSwap.com is our solution to a big problem in crypto: how to easily get into and out of the crypto world without a centralized entity controlling the assets you are exchanging. It allows you to buy and sell crypto, from fiat, without giving your money or personal information to an entity you don’t necessarily trust. We believe this to be the easiest way to swap crypto and fiat, while staying as close as possible to one of the fundamental cornerstones of crypto: self-custody. We want to spread the word and let everybody know that SuperSimpleSwap.com exists! And to do that we are now introducing referrals, a way to reward supporters that educate others about the advantages of using a true self-custodial swap service like SuperSimpleSwap. Now you can log in to the SuperSimpleSwap.com Referrals dashboard with your email, create referral links and earn BTC or NIM from every swap that's made using your referral link. Every time someone clicks a referral link you've created and then buys or sells crypto using SuperSimpleSwap.com, you'll receive 0.25% of the amount. But wait…there's more! Our widget creator also lets you customize and integrate it into any app or website. Try it out at referrals.supersimpleswap.com  Below you can find a video tutorial and a walkthrough of these new features.  SuperSimpleSwap.com Referrals dashboard The new dashboard is the entry point for all the features included in this new version. At a glance, it shows you a list with every time your referral link has been used. Every time someone uses one of your links you'll receive a reward and it will be displayed in this list. To log in you only need to input your email address and you'll receive an email containing a magic link that will take you to the dashboard. The first time you log in you'll also need to input a “partner-id”, in the image below we use satoshi-nakamoto. Next you can add your Nimiq and/or Bitcoin addresses to receive referral rewards, but you can also add this later. Remember you can use the Nimiq Wallet (which supports both coins) and, by clicking the ‘+’ sign, conveniently populate both addresses. 💡The partner-id cannot be deleted or changed so check twice to make sure it is correct.  💡Keep in mind that every time you log into the dashboard you will need to input your email and authenticate with the new magic link sent via email.    At the top you can also see a summary of the total swaps – and the amount swapped – using your referral links; as well as the total available rewards. We know you might need to add more complex filters for some other reason, so there's also a button to conveniently export all swap data to CSV.  💡Rewards are accounted for in USD. When you request a payout you will receive the USD amount equivalent of “Available Rewards” in the cryptocurrency of your choice: NIM or BTC.   The dashboard also lets you filter the data based on timeframe, currency and link/widget used. This will come in handy for users that have large swap volumes and wish to define which links are working better and under which conditions.  And finally on the left you can see a menu with the three ways you can earn referrals. Let’s dive deeper into each one. Referral links This section is very straightforward. It allows you to create referral links that you can use later to share to your friends or audience. Here you can also download an image file containing the QR code. Remember every link needs a unique name which cannot be repeated. You can create all the links you want and use them in different places in your app or in different publications.  Keep in mind that links cannot be deleted so check twice to make sure the name of your link is correct.  Widget Creator and API You would think this area of the app would be complicated – but we've managed to make it super simple. You basically create a widget by clicking “Add New”, give it a name, and customize the colors. By customizing it you can embed SuperSimpleSwap.com in your app or website while staying on brand. The last step is to simply copy the HTML code and move it to your site or application.

            <description><![CDATA[With Nimiq’s evolution to Proof-of-Stake now in the DevNet phase, we've begun to integrate staking into the Nimiq Wallet]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The switching of Nimiq’s protocol to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is an upgrade long awaited by the Nimiq community. Our blockchain engineers recently published the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake DevNet release-candidate and shared RPC access to interested devs for them to test how it fits their use cases. We've continued to fine-tune and test the DevNet and, with current RPC access ready to go, the next natural step was to begin integration of DevNet staking into the Nimiq Wallet.  Today, we're very happy to present the first DevNet-version of Nimiq with Proof-of-Stake in the Nimiq Wallet. Nimiq with Proof-of-Stake – codename "Albatross" As we're getting to the point where this upgrade is beginning to be tested not only by developers but also by non-technical users, we'd like to take this opportunity to state that going forward we are looking to talk about the Proof-of-Stake or “Albatross” upgrade that is happening to Nimiq rather than referring to Nimiq 2.0. Similar to Bitcoin not having version numbers, Nimiq remains Nimiq (and NIM remains NIM) as proposed upgrades in the underlying software are adopted by the Nimiq community. A reminder of what is (and what is not) the Proof-of-Stake DevNet The Nimiq Developer Network, or DevNet for short, is a laboratory for all Nimiq developers to experiment and test out the new Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol. Since it's set up as a testing environment, the DevNet is subject to resets, with everything that that entails (staking rewards lost, accounts no longer holding funds, etc). The current Nimiq Mainnet and the Nimiq DevNet are completely separate networks and are not compatible with each other. Please make sure not to send real NIM or to use your actual Nimiq account in the DevNet. If you want to test the DevNet, always create a fresh account - and keep in mind that it does not work within any app in the Nimiq Ecosystem.  Current Status of DevNet Staking in the Wallet With the progress that we've made, we felt that this was the perfect time to share early access with our community, so that you can get a feel for just how Proof-of-Stake works with the Nimiq Wallet. Having said that, there are some things to keep in mind while trying it out: The Wallet is running on the real deal, and your feedback is invaluable The Nimiq Wallet is actually connected to a running network of  Proof-of-Stake DevNet nodes currently managed by the Nimiq team. Nothing you see in the DevNet staking Wallet is a simulation. Sending NIM, staking, un-staking and payouts are real (in devNIM). Currently, our focus lies on running the DevNet under regular conditions. Security hardening will follow later. If you find anything that feels like a bug, please share it in the Nimiq Forum. Validators and Delegated Proof-of-Stake The Nimiq wallet allows users to delegate their stake to a validator through RPC. Nimiq Proof-of-Stake is non-custodial, so delegating stake to a validator pool does not bear the risk of surrendering the NIM to the pool manager. We are currently working on enabling community developers to become validators in the DevNet. Since at the moment there's no support for others to create validating pools, the only validating pools available in the Wallet are fictional, just for testing purposes. We do use settings for each pool to showcase the trust score sorting of the Wallet. Because these settings are up to the validator some aspects of the staking experience depend on them. When more external validator pools are added, the different settings and configurations of different validator pools can be tested. Examples of this: Percentage of rewards: validators charge for their services Payout times: validators may freely choose the frequency of payouts Minimum payouts: validators could require a minimum staking amount Current rewards and staking/un-staking times might change Many variables of the protocol are going to be changed and fine-tuned to find the best setting for Nimiq Proof-of-Stake, which is one of the main intentions of the Nimiq DevNet and the tests we run with the Wallet. For this reason, some aspects of the staking user experience might be different to those that Nimiq Proof-of-Stake will have when it reaches its final stage. Some of these include:  Block time and transactions per second  The emission curve of block rewards The time it takes for a user to receive rewards after beginning staking (payout times) NIM and DevNet NIM are not compatible! Nimiq Mainnet and Nimiq Proof-of-Stake DevNet (Albatross) run in completely different networks. Although you can send DevNet NIM with your friends to test it out, do not send real NIM to the DevNet wallet because they will be lost forever. DO NOT use your mainnet account in any way. In any case, it doesn't hold any funds in DevNet. Just create a fresh DevNet account for testing these features. A generous faucet provides the NIM necessary. Payout history and calculated rewards are not included yet The interface is a work-in-progress, too. Some parts are still missing, or are subject to change. While the staking feature works and rewards can be seen as your stake grows with each payout, the history of these payouts is not yet implemented. Special validators are available who will not add the rewards to your stake but instead send them to you directly. In case you want to see a hefty transaction history, delegate your stake to “Monopooly" or "Cool pool”.  We'll keep you posted when we add new features and functionalities for you to try, so stay tuned to our official Twitter account to learn more and be amongst the first to test them out! Enough! Take me to the DevNet Wallet and let me stake! Thanks for bearing with us and reading all of that important information! You can test out the Nimiq DevNet Wallet here: wallet.v2.nimiq-testnet.com. Plus we prepared a full tutorial which can be found here. We're planning a community event to test the Wallet all together, with cool prizes involved for users that are actively testing it and sharing it with their friends and followers. Happy DevNet Staking and Pura Vida! Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[If you're a public-facing business and you can answer yes to these two questions, then the article below will change you]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're a public-facing business and you can answer yes to these two questions, then the article below will change your life. Do you want to accept fast, frictionless payments with no fee? Ever? Do you want to be in complete control of your money? At all times? With no exception? If you can answer yes to those two questions, then read on, because this will change how you do business forever. Up until now, cryptocurrencies have been missing use cases. While theoretically heralding a new kind of money, a new dawn of finance, instead they've become an investment tool. People buy some bitcoin, buy some eth, and sit and watch to see if the numbers go up or go down. But we at Nimiq have never thought like that. We at Nimiq have always had our eye on ways to use crypto to improve lives, to make business easier, to make sure that your money belongs to you - and only you. And that you can access it - and use it - no matter where you are in the world. Without waiting. And without having to pay for the privilege. Which is why we've come up with a brand new, never-been-done-before easy-to-use crypto payment app - cryptopayment.link - that you can use on your smartphone or tablet. So your customers can pay in crypto: Bitcoin, Ethereum or Nimiq. As easily and as effortlessly as if they were paying with a credit card. The ease of it is a thing of beauty. And the fact that it's free? Well that's a thing of beauty too. A tool for crypto adoption At the moment, there are 18,000 businesses accepting payment in crypto. There are around 300 million people who own crypto. And 17 million people in the US alone who don't currently own crypto but declare themselves ready to use it to pay for goods and services.  All this points to a fast growing trend for cryptocurrency to emerge from its raison d' etre as an investment tool, and to embed itself into mainstream society as a way that people are ready and willing to pay. As Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Assets Holding states: "You should be taking this technology as seriously as you should have been taking the development of the Internet in the early 1990’s." – Blythe Masters Nimiq is, of course, known to provide the ONLY digital wallet that works without the need for ANY middleman. No coin exchange, no trusted third party. Wait, you may be saying. Isn't that what crypto has been anyway? Well, yes and no. Because no matter what, you still had to sign up to a crypto exchange to be able to buy and sell your crypto. You still had to establish your credentials, hook up a bank account or a credit card, prove you're who you say you are, log in to the system, and let yourself be tracked. But Nimiq changed that: with us, you can create a digital wallet in five clicks of your mouse. In under two minutes. And you don't have to jump through any hoops. That digital wallet that you just created is its own node on the blockchain; it's you. It's your crypto identity, and it lets you start sending money straight away. But that's already old news. Now we're leaping ahead with new innovations to put crypto to work - and what better place to start than with a way for people to pay on-the-ground, at point of sale? Which is why we came up with Cryptopayment.link. Let's talk about a use case. You run a restaurant. Your customer wants to pay in crypto. What happens when he wants to pay his bill? Your waiter walks over with his or her tablet or smartphone, calls up the app, taps in the price of the meal - which is displayed in dollars as well as the BTC, ETH and/or NIM equivalent, as well as in QR code form - and hands the tablet to the customer. The customer takes their smartphone, opens their digital wallet app, snaps the QR code, and the wheels turn. Your waiter smiles at your customer. Your customer smiles back. There's a delightful little ping within a minute, and payment is complete. That's it. And of course let's not forget that Cryptopayment.link is completely free to use. Unlike using services like paypal or stripe, using crypto with Nimiq means that there's not a penny to pay. Win-win, in other words. One last thing: When your employees use the app - which has your digital wallet address in it - they can't: See into your wallet - so your money stays private. Because everyone likes their privacy, right? Replace your digital wallet in the app with their own. Your digital wallet address is locked in. There's no point in waiting until your competitor starts offering a way to pay quickly and cleanly in crypto before you accept the inevitable and decide to try it out too. Try out Cryptopayment.link today, plug in your digital wallet address, and join the revolution. Because accepting crypto in your business can now be easy. Can be frictionless. And without fees. Pura Vida

            <description><![CDATA[We are fine-tuning the last details before launching the next version of Cryptopayment.link. What's planned for the next]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome back, Nimiq supporters!  There is some big news coming from behind-the-scenes of Nimiq's new version of Cryptopayment.link. Nimiq's core values of simplicity, easy payments for everyone, and reducing entry barriers for new users are still going strong. Nimiq has shifted focus on creating an even more accessible and intuitive app for business owners to receive payments with a new dashboard experience and more powerful tools to maximize the software's potential. You will find a full ChangeLog after Cryptopayment.link has launched, but we will include some highlights here.  "Charge Now" function  The most significant added feature will be the addition of the "Charge Now" function. "Charge Now" enables a simplified, built-in flow for accepting crypto when the seller and buyer are in the same physical location. It works like at a Point of Sale in a retail shop. The process starts with the seller showing a QR payment code on their device to the buyer. The buyer scans the QR code with their crypto wallet app, which can then be used to complete the transaction. Cryptopayment.link shows a success notification in real-time. We've added a fallback option with the payment details in case the QR code on the seller's device can't be scanned properly by the buyer.  Dashboard and Employee UI  The next significant addition to the Nimiq Ecosystem is introducing the Cryptopayment.link dashboard and the access for retail employees. This new feature allows business owners to empower their employees to accept crypto payments on the owner's behalf. Access to this feature starts with the account owner creating a hard-coded subsidiary link that an employee utilizes to access Cryptopayment.link from the Employee User Interface. The Employee UI is minimal and intuitive since it gives the employee only one option: accept crypto payments on the owner's behalf to the pre-configured owner's wallet. This feature will open up a lot of potential sales to any size business and can easily be scalable to fit any circumstances.  Another major highlight of the upcoming version is the addition of over 75 new compatible fiat currencies. This update brings the total number of compatible fiat currencies to 169! Currently, this access is limited to the API version, but web support will be added soon.  We have spent much time listening to our current user base of small business owners and vendors regarding UI feedback. The feedback allowed us to improve payment flows. In this update, the payment request creation and payment flows are improved based on the input of merchants, small businesses, and freelancers that already use Cryptopayment.link. Next, this update includes a significant overhaul of the dashboard UI to create a more visually pleasing experience for users. Several other minor features, including sharing payments over social media and miscellaneous updates, have been added. More details will be available in the complete ChangeLog.  Stay tuned and plugged in for the official announcement of the 2.0 update by next week!  Pura Vida

            <description><![CDATA[Sending Crypto to a new user has never been easier]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Cashlinks are an amazing and unique feature of the Nimiq Blockchain that allows you to introduce your friends and family to the “Crypto Space” by sending them NIM in a message over WhatsApp, SMS, Email or virtually any messaging service. When someone receives a Cashlink, they enter the world of non-custodial and peer-to-peer payments. A place where you — and only you — control your money, free of borders and censorship. What’s great about Nimiq Cashlinks is that this new crypto user will join in an ideal situation: Without the need to already have an account address While receiving some NIM directly from someone they know With the least amount of friction possible Connecting directly to the payment network from their browser With the most user-friendly, best-looking interface! I want to invite my friends now! How do I do it? To send a Cashlink to a friend who’s new to crypto, simply visit wallet.nimiq.com and click the “Send” button. You will find the Cashlink option at the bottom of the screen. All you then need to do is create (fund) the Cashlink and share it with your friend via Messenger, SMS or Email. What will your friend see on their end? When your friend clicks the link, their browser will open up. And guess what? Because Nimiq is browser-first, no extra downloads or installations are needed. Instead, Nimiq will greet your friend with the personal message you entered and guide them through creating a Nimiq Account. All in just about 30 seconds! Why is Nimiq the only cryptocurrency that supports non-custodial Cashlinks? Let’s start by describing what “Non-Custodial” actually is. It basically means that you are always in control of your money and at no point does a third party (Nimiq or anybody else) hold custody of it (or its private key). This, as you might imagine, provides higher security than centralized services which can be hacked (and have been hacked multiple times). Instead, your money is protected by cryptography and the entire Nimiq Network, rather than a single entity that might fail. As long as you are the sole custodian of your funds, you are the only one responsible for them. This is the trust-less, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency spirit! Now that we have established the importance of non-custodial payments, let’s move on to Cashlinks. In essence, a Cashlink is a cryptocurrency payment done over text. Sending money via text requires these texts to contain the necessary information for the recipient to assume control of the money. It also requires some kind of software that the recipient would use to manage the newly received crypto assets, e.g. “some kind of wallet”. The concept of Cashlinks has been part of the Nimiq Blockchain since the very beginning of the project, going back to the very first Betanet released in mid-2017, months before the Nimiq Mainnet. This feature comes naturally to Nimiq. The key here is that “kind of wallet”. Thanks to Nimiq being Browser-first, users can use the Nimiq Wallet (Nimiq’s official wallet) by just entering a webpage — wallet.nimiq.com to be specific. The Nimiq Wallet works completely client-side, like MyEtherWallet. But the Wallet also runs a Nimiq Node in your browser which is where Nimiq stands out when compared to a web app like MyEtherWallet because with MEW you have to either use one of their nodes (which can get congested or hacked, remember?) or run your own Ethereum node which requires the know-how, a robust server, and good Internet connection. In other words, running your own Ethereum node is no piece of cake. But running a Nimiq Browser-Node IS a piece of cake. If you haven’t already, then try it out here! Don’t worry, we’ll wait for you to come back. Done? Easy, right!? We can check off the “some kind of wallet” question thanks to Nimiq’s unique client-side, no-installation, run-your-own-node magic. Every new user who clicks on a Cashlink is shown the Cashlink contents and is invited to create a Nimiq Account. After Account creation, the user can claim the Cashlink and receive its funds into their newly created Account. The next challenge is the “necessary information for the recipient to hold control of the money.’’ If you are thinking “private key” you are on the right track. If you didn’t think private key (or don’t know what that is) don’t worry, Nimiq requires no technical knowledge. Just keep in mind that a private key is all someone needs to control the crypto assets at a specific account address. Usually, you should keep your private key only to yourself (thus the word “private”) because anyone who has access to the key can control the funds which mean: steal them. That is why the real problem here is that if you send a private key to a new user then also you know that user’s private key, and you could therefore still control the funds. The solution is again Nimiq’s browser-first technology. By creating a go-between account that holds the Cashlink funds, you can send the private key of that temporary account to your friend with peace of mind. As soon as your friend has the key, they send a transaction to their own new account that only they control. To summarize Usually, sending crypto over a text message requires the recipient to install a “wallet”, which is a piece of software or application to manage that specific cryptocurrency. It also requires you to send a key that controls the funds that are being sent. Nimiq is different thanks to being browser-first. The Nimiq Cashlink feature creates a temporary account to hold the NIM User A wants to send and creates a link from that. User A can now send the link to User B. Clicking this links opens Nimiq’s wallet app — directly in the browser, no software installation necessary. An onboarding process will greet User B, guide them through creating their own account in a few seconds and afterwards transfer the NIM from the temporary account to the newly created account that only User B controls (has the private key). The result of this process is a happy new user with a cryptocurrency address and some NIM ready to be used — without requiring a Nimiq node managed by a third party. All this in under a minute! Exciting isn’t it? Try it out and invite some friends! Now that you have learned about Nimiq Cashlinks, you might have noticed that a Cashlink requires the creation of a temporary account which is not used again after the Cashlink was used. The reason not to use this go-between account again is because two users already have control of that account (from the link), which is of course insecure. Thus the account is not reusable. A Cashlink also requires two transactions on the Nimiq Blockchain. One transaction goes from User A to the temporary account, the second transaction moves the NIM from the temporary account to User B. Because Cashlinks require two transactions and the creation of an account, they are not recommended for transactions where the recipient address is known. Direct transactions between two accounts are twice as fast and require no temporary account and no shared private key. Cashlinks really shine when you want to reach users who don’t yet have an account address on the Nimiq Blockchain. Cashlinks have been a much-requested feature from the Nimiq Community and Team Nimiq is very excited to deliver them at the expected high level of Nimiq’s quality. We encourage all Nimiq supporters to introduce friends and family to the Nimiq Ecosystem by sending them Cashlinks. And please share their reaction and post them over on Twitter/Facebook/Instagram with the hashtag #Cashlinks! To kick-start the usage of Cashlinks, Team Nimiq will be handing out some brand new engaging Cashlink business cards at the Web3Summit and CCC events in Berlin as well as the BDLT event in Vienna, where Nimiq Developers will be giving a talk and a workshop. This way attendants of these technical conferences can experience first-hand how easy it is to manage your own money in the Nimiq Ecosystem. Cashlinks are the ultimate onboarding tool and we hope you have as much fun inviting new people with them as we do! Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Announcing the collaboration of Nimiq with Coinpay, a fintech company based in Costa Rica, starting off with the listing]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited to announce the collaboration of Nimiq with Coinpay, a fintech company based in Costa Rica, starting off with the listing of NIM in the Coinpay product suite including their wallet, exchange and debit card available in many countries around the world. Learn more about Coinpay on their website. Nimiq is on a mission to bring crypto to everyone, in every part of the world. The project is already in different stages of  collaborating with European fintech companies including Salamantex, TEN31 Bank and Bluecode. The time has come to start branching out and bring the full Nimiq experience to a region of the world with an enormous crypto adoption potential: Latin America. Nimiq has strong ties in Costa Rica: The open source Nimiq Blockchain protocol was inspired in Costa Rica, and several team members are themselves from this country. As a project with one foot in Latin America, we are well aware of the barriers that users come up against when trying out crypto for the first time. There is currently no easy way to buy/sell crypto since most popular platforms do not yet support fiat conversions in the region. This prevents new users from testing out crypto payments, and new merchants from accepting it. Nimiq OASIS is naturally a solution that would solve a lot of problems in Costa Rica and Latam. However, to enable OASIS Fiat HTLC in a country, we need a fintech entity with instant settlement bank payments to implement it, such as Coinpay. Collaborating with Coinpay Coinpay is a Costarrican fintech company with several years of experience in crypto payments. This collaboration allows Nimiq to benefit from their ecosystem which includes: Connection to the Costarrican bank system for a Nimiq OASIS implementation Crypto debit cards available around the world Gift card services in over 100+ stores Exchange with local fiat pairs. As a first milestone, Coinpay is supporting NIM in their Wallet and Exchange which are available not only in Latin America but in many countries including the US and countries from the EU. Separately, it enables users in Costa Rica to use Coinpay as an off-ramp from NIM to USD for up to 2'500 USD monthly. Bank withdrawal outside of Costa Rica is not supported currently, but Coinpay indeed plans to support more countries for this feature. Going forward Coinpay  intends to work on allowing users around the world to get debit card supporting top-up with NIM, paying for their utility bills with NIM and also buy goods with gift cards in many countries. Stay tuned for upcoming announcements regarding these additional services!  In parallel we are working with Coinpay to enable Nimiq OASIS through their banking infrastructure. When implemented it will allow people in Costa Rica to be able to buy and sell crypto from Costarrican bank accounts through the fiat atomic swap, a service as non-custodial as possible. Coinpay has plans to expand to other countries in the region, which would in turn also enable OASIS to get to new countries and more people. Nimiq Adoption in Central America  Together with Coinpay, we want to solve one of the main barriers for adoption: easily swapping crypto to fiat. This is a big pain point for merchants: before they accept crypto they need the certainty of being able to swap it back to fiat in case they need the fiat cash flow to pay external providers. This new feature joins our current effort of educating and onboarding merchants in the region, which also include: A dedicated team that visits merchants, educates them and provides technical support; Developing a crypto map that will list merchants that accept crypto, connecting crypto users with crypto merchants; Organizing frequent meetups in different parts of the country to further educate new users into the crypto economy; Increased marketing efforts to generate more adoption in the region. Coinpay plans on rolling out these services in the coming months and  we are very excited about the first milestone: from now on, NIM is available in Coinpay’s exchange and wallet, with NIM to USD off-ramp supported in Costa Rica.  This is our first collaboration, but there is a lot of potential for the future. We would like to end by thanking Coinpay for joining the Nimiq mission and believing in the overarching ethos: crypto for everyone, crypto for humans. Pura Vida

            <description><![CDATA[A community update about Nimiq OASIS EU and Latin America]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Dear Nimiq Community: As most of you know, Nimiq invested in a German Bank, at the time known as WEG Bank and currently known as TEN31 Bank. TEN31 Bank has led incredible efforts in Germany to onboard and service crypto related entities, even though there had previously been no precedent of German banks engaging in these activities. Saying they were navigating in uncharted waters is an understatement. The driving force behind Nimiq’s intention in investing in TEN31 Bank was to bridge the gap between traditional financial services and crypto-related transactions and users. The solution we built and deployed, allows users with “SEPA Instant” bank accounts to transact directly with a hashed time-lock contract and execute a non-custodial and almost immediate swap of Euro and cryptocurrencies. This system is known as “OASIS”  (Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme). As with all new technologies, certain operational challenges surface. A particular challenge that arises for the effective use of OASIS is market liquidity. So, even though OASIS provides a non-custodial transfer of cryptocurrencies and a counter transfer of fiat currency through a “SEPA Instant” enabled bank account, such trade requires a counterparty to either purchase or sell the cryptocurrency being purchased or sold by the user. This is a similar challenge as faced by decentralized exchanges in their beginnings in the year 2017. The liquidity challenges were resolved by decentralized exchanges using liquidity pools that would have funds available immediately for users to interact and trade against. In the case of OASIS, the liquidity challenge was addressed by having a disregarded entity (not directly linked to any Nimiq company) to serve as a market maker and to provide the necessary liquidity for near instant swaps.   This process and the services provided by the market maker worked very well for more than a year and a half and TEN31 Bank did not have any regulatory challenges in allowing this market maker to operate within the scope of these services. The monumental collapse of FTX has galvanized regulators around the world to tighten their grip and interpretation of rules. As a result, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany has led TEN31 Bank to halt the services facilitated through the market maker that Nimiq has engaged for OASIS to effectively function, until such time as that market maker holds a German and/or European specific “proprietary trading” license.  The market maker that Nimiq has engaged for the provision of this service, does not currently have a European based “proprietary trading” license. As with any kind of financial services licenses, particularly in jurisdictions such as the EU, this process takes time to complete and legal and financial requirements to be met. Given this situation, TEN31 Bank and Nimiq Team are forced to pause the operation of the OASIS function that allows users in the EU with a “SEPA Instant” enabled bank account to swap EUR and cryptocurrencies. Note that this does NOT affect the possibility of users to purchase cryptocurrencies using credit/debit cards. With OASIS Pro in its final release step, the successful community testing, and the new referral system ready to go, this unexpected pause comes at a point in time when Team Nimiq was excited to present results to the community and eager to ramp-up marketing for OASIS. The team is actively seeking to engage the services of a European licensed market maker as well as additional options that can allow the OASIS service to operate with SEPA Instant.  On a related note, as a worldwide first for NIM, Costa Rican payment service provider coinpay.cr will shortly enable the purchasing and selling of NIM for fiat currencies US Dollars (USD) and Costa Rica Colones (CRC, local currency of Costa Rica). In addition, in partnership with another Costa Rican financial institution, Nimiq is working on implementing OASIS for the SINPE system (the national instant payment system of Costa Rica and  equivalent of SEPA Instant in Europe) to enable both the SuperSimpleSwap service and in-wallet non-custodial swaps between NIM and USD or CRC. Costa Rica will be the first country in Latin America in which this functionality will be available and Nimiq is excited to continue exploring this emerging audience of potentially more than six hundred million users who currently lack meaningful fiat on- and offramps for crypto!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq 2.0 implementation has finally reached a release candidate phase, making it possible for community developers to begin testing their use cases for Nimiq 2.0. It has been relatively quiet around the Community Funding Board lately for various reasons including of course Covid-19, as well as our community developers waiting for a release candidate of Nimiq 2.0 where they can test their use cases in the certain knowledge that major changes will occur. A quick reminder of what the Community Funding Board is and how it works! The Community Funding Board, or CFB for short, is responsible for fostering the growth of the Nimiq Community and its participation in the Nimiq project. In order to do that, the CFB reviews and discusses the potential funding of projects presented by community members. To help make this happen, it has an annual budget of up to 50k USD. The purpose of funding community proposals is to empower developers by providing them support, not only financially but also as regards technical matters. Community members who have an idea for a project and would like to see it come to life can apply by presenting their project in writing in the Nimiq Community forum. Want to apply for community funding? Then click here to visit our forum and submit your application. Community members who actively support Nimiq’s Community and ecosystem are also recognized by the Community Funding Board with the Most Valuable Community Member awards to honor their valuable work. So far, over 30 members have been rewarded in this way, and you can be sure there will be many more! So don't be shy: showcase your involvement in our community channels to get noticed by the CFB. Community Funding Board Structure There are six members in total, of which 3 are community-elected representatives and 3 are Nimiq team members. The election for the Community Representative takes place every 6 months, the exception being the last term, which was extended due to the unexpected situations mentioned above. The Board decides on proposals from the community every 3 months; a simple majority of over 50% is required for each decision. There are 3 possible outcomes for a proposal: Accepted, Rejected, or Request for Modification of the proposal. The result of the meeting is then shared with the public on the forum and on our Community Funding Board blog! The next step: The Community Funding Board is holding new elections! Want to stand for election as a Community Representative? Then now is your chance! We hold new elections for the 3 community representatives on Monday, July 18th to start the new CFB period with the community members who are currently most engaged. If you are elected as a representative, you can actively shape the future of the Nimiq ecosystem - don't miss this chance! How to apply? Create a post in the Nimiq Forum to run in the next elections. A short introduction about yourself, your Telegram and Discord handles, and a bio about your involvement in the Nimiq community is all we need from you. Application submission closing date is the 15th of July 2022. Community assemble! We bring the Community Funding Board back up to speed and encourage every developer, designer and Nimiq supporter to test the first versions of Nimiq 2.0 and submit their project funding proposals in the Nimiq Forum. We've also created the NIMcubator with the purpose of supporting your project’s creation, finding collaborators and helping to prepare your Community Funding Proposal. If you are looking to get support from the NIMcubator, which consists of a majority of our most active community members, join the NIMcubator Brainstorming Unit in Telegram or Discord. Let's build the greatest apps the world has ever seen! Now is the time! Pura Vida

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We welcome our new community representatives to the new Community Funding Board election period! We're excited to have Faberto, Revolution_Coin and Albermonte on board with us. We'd like to give a big thank you to Maestro for his involvement in the previous board, and we're looking forward to working with Albermonte again, who is starting his second term. As part of our recent meeting, members both of the previous board and the new board discussed the duration of the board terms. We initially decided on 6 months per term, but we all agreed that it was too short. So, we've decided to increase the election period of the Community Funding Board from 6 months to 12 months. This will give each representative more time to settle into their role and contribute more effectively to the Board. Our Community Proposals for the 19th Funding Board: NimiqLive by Harley Link to proposal NimiqLive is a Twitch livestream service that gives viewers the opportunity to learn more about Nimiq by watching videos and getting rewarded with NIM for doing so. Community developer Harley has asked for funding in this proposal to expand the service and give out more rewards. We generally like the idea and would like to support it with funding, but we have a few requirements and have made a counter-proposal with a smaller budget as a starting point. Outcome: Counterproposal We will review the funding for NimiqLive every three months and make a decision about whether or not to continue funding. We start with a budget of 200 USD in NIM per month and would require analytics data of the Twitch stream to decide in the next Community Funding Board meeting about the amount of the funding. The stream would have to run 24/7 UAH Motorsport Sponsoring by Albermonte We do not have a forum post proposal of this one UAH Motorsport is a racing team started by a group of future engineers from Universidad de Alcalá in Spain. Their goal is to build the perfect electric race car that can perform well on any type of track, and represent them in the international university Formula Student (SAE) competition. UAH Motorsport would like to request a Nimiq sponsorship for their team. In exchange, they are willing to place the Nimiq logo on their race car, teeshirts and merchandise, and include Nimiq in their social posts when promoting their activities. If for whatever reason the racecar is not built and we cannot be shown as being a sponsor, the entire amount will be returned. Outcome: Approved (“Proud package”) We're excited to announce that we're sponsoring the UAH Motorsports Team with a budget of 5200 USD in NIM. We believe that this kind of sponsorship can bring the right kind of attention, especially if we can support innovative teams and upcoming engineers who are building for a combustionless future in racing. Validator as a Service by Faberto and David Link to proposal The goal of this project is to enable non-technical people to run a validator for themselves, so they don't have to rely on a pool. The proposal is to offer a low-trust service for both parties. Faberto and David will never be in control of the user's money or the money earned while staking.  Instead of taking a cut of the rewards, their plan is to take a fixed fee for operating the validator nodes. This means that, for the user, the service will be financially beneficial once an amount of >$35k is staked (in comparison to the average pool fees; based on $10 Validator, 7% Reward, 5% Pool Fee).  They intend to open-source the project with viable documentation, with income being used to cover the infrastructure costs of the service. Outcome: Approved with rewards for milestones  We like the idea of decentralizing staking pools and allowing services to build their own validator as a service platform based on the developed source code. Our counterproposal to pay out the reward based on milestones instead of hours has been accepted by Faberto and David and they have already started working on the project. As a precondition we made the payment dependent on the following milestones which have to be reached to get the reward. After conducting a review of Milestone 1, we are pleased to announce that it has been successfully completed already. Milestone 1 - $5000 in NIM Infrastructure and blockchain technology running History Node Monitoring Node  Ability to spin up validators with commands  Signing validator transactions  Controlling validator transactions Documentation on how to reproduce the state of milestone Milestone 2 - $4000 in NIM Define user flow and UI design and improve maintainability of core system Monitoring including thresholds for alerts Frontend Design/UX including payment flow Draft of informational Website Milestone 3 - $3000 in NIM Create a system that allows the user to set up a validator via the UI Connection between chain information node to get chain data Backend validator handling Validator configuration/key creation Finalizing informational website Milestone 4 - $3000 in NIM Finalize the system by adding payment and informational dashboards for customers Implementation of the payment systems in frontend and backend Finalization and cleanup Community Member awards We are always happy to reward our most valuable community members with our Community Awards. These awards are given for special achievements that add great value to the Nimiq community, and we would like to say thank you on behalf of everyone to the following people: Community Developer Brantje (Sander) for creating the Albatross Dev-Net blockchain explorer albatross.nimiq.tools - 100k $NIM reward Community Moderator Yeppa for taking care of requests of any kind over many Nimiq Telegram groups - 30k $NIM reward FonsL and Albermonte for building the Nimiq Treasury game - 50k $NIM reward each Changes After discussing about it, we have decided to increase the election period of the Community Funding Board from 6 months to 12 months. This will better allow each representative to settle into their role and contribute more effectively to the Board. Thank you for joining us as we continue working towards our main goal: Adoption of the Nimiq Payment Ecosystem. Until the next one. Go Nimiq!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nimiq Community Elections have now ended. We'd like to thank everybody who participated and thereby helped to shape the future of the Nimiq Ecosystem, by casting their vote and rooting for their favorite candidates. We hope you enjoyed the process – and we welcome any and all feedback on how we might improve these elections in the future. Please share any feedback you have in this section of the Nimiq Forum. We also want to thank all the candidates for their goodwill and their passion for the Nimiq project. It's thanks to members like you that this project stays resolutely community-driven, with more activity and more members each day. You guys rock! So who won!? After being open for 9 days, we now have the results. In total, 131 community members participated, voting with 38 Million NIM! We know everybody is eager to find out who'll be representing the community over the next 6 months. So without further ado, here are the results: Since every vote was signed with a Nimiq transaction, results are recorded immutably in the Nimiq Blockchain. A snapshot was taken at the end of the election. Ranked choices of votes were counted according to a normalized geometric progression. That means the 1st choice of every vote got 1 point per NIM, the 2nd ½ point, 3rd ¼ point per NIM and so on. You can see the results for yourself in the Nimiq Voting app What will happen next? The next step is a quick introduction to the new members of the community funding board. We've also selected the team members who'll integrate the funding board together with the winners of the Community Elections. This time the team representatives are Claudio, Micha, and Richy. After everybody is up to speed on how the workflow and inner protocol function, we'll host the first funding board's official meeting of this new term. In this first meeting, the old funding board members will join, with the new members acting as spectators. That way the new members can see first hand how the funding board meetings work, inspired by our seasoned board members' experience. And finally, the next step will be the usual funding board meeting report that will show the results of this first meeting. We are looking forward to this meeting and seeing what the new candidates bring to the table. Last but not least, we would like to thank the members of our previous board. It was an unusually long term for the community board, filled with unanticipated challenges. It was amazing to have such proactive and committed board members to help us navigate this last term. From Micha, Richy and Sven, we would like to say personally that we really appreciate all the time and the thoughtful discussions we had together. We'll miss our meetings, but we know you guys will stay around in the community, and hope to catch up in the near future. Thank you Timo, Wekkel, Maestro and Albermonte, we could not have done this without you guys! We would like to finish by thanking again the entire Nimiq community for supporting this project, and thank you in advance for helping us give it a unified direction. The Nimiq community is one of the most important things about this project that goes to make it unique and very special. Pura Vida!

            <description><![CDATA[New report for the period following July 2021]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In line with the last report, we would like to present an updated overview of the assets and use of funds for the Nimiq project, as well as updated details of the distribution of NIM tokens and the circulating supply. The period covered since the last report is August 1, 2021 through July 31, 2022. The report indicates a steady burn-rate as well as a reasonable decrease in net assets due to unfavorable crypto market value developments. Assets and use of funds Assets The Nimiq Project continues to hold a variety of liquid and non-liquid assets. The 9.9% stake in German TEN31 (WEG) Bank AG is valued at original participation valuation and does not reflect potential changes in such valuation. As of publication of the report the Nimiq Project had the following assets: 205.7 BTC ~ US$ 4.82 Mio 1'661.4 ETH ~ US$ 3.07 Mio 377.0 Mio NIM (besides genesis NIM) ~ US$ 0.56 Mio   EUR, USD & USDC ~ US$ 3.36 Mio Stake in TEN31 (WEG) Bank ~ US$ 3.50 Mio Real Estate ~ US$ 1.10 Mio Loan to ImpactX Foundation: ~ US$ 33.8K Reserves (see "Use of funds") ~ US$ (-0.86 Mio) Total Net Assets: ~US$ 15.58 Mio Use of funds The use of funds from the end of July 2021 up to the end of July 2022 breaks down as follows: Product Development Contracting, Compensations: This includes all research, design, implementation and maintenance work regarding the Nimiq protocol on its way to switching from Proof-of-work to Proof-of-stake, the Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme (OASIS) and related apps and systems. The report indicates stable contracting expenses and team size. Going forward a reasonable increase may be incurred due to continued growth of the team and inflation adjusted compensations. An additional amount of ~US$ 260K continues to be reserved and due pending achievement of development goals (release of Proof of Stake for Nimiq, etc). ~US$ $1’611.1K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~47.1% of total (~59.9% of non-extraordinary) Marketing, Content, Community: This includes expenses related to creating and distributing marketable video and written content, branding and sponsorships, swag production, user and consumer surveys, community rewards and campaigns, social media management and industry conference expenses. It also includes the membership contribution for the Blockchain for Europe organization and community programs such as the Bug Bounty Program, Community Project Funding with a reserve of US$ 50K for the next 12 months. An additional amount of US$ 50K is reserved and due pending listing related pre-staking provisions. ~US$ $523.1K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~15.3% of total (~19.4% of non-extraordinary) Legal, Administration, Taxes: This includes legal, tax and administrative expenses regarding corporate maintenance, contract review, accounting, professional support from Lara Legal Corp and additional task specific international legal counsel i.e. for pursuing required licenses, trademarking, terms of services, privacy policies, legal memorandums, etc. ~US$ $136.2K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~4.0% of total (~5.1% of non-extraordinary) Digital Operations, Equipment: This includes expenses related to hosting, hardware, software, licensing, communications, domains, and other development tools and platforms. ~US$ $105.2K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~3.1% of total (~3.9% of non-extraordinary) Travel, F&B: This includes expenses related to transportation, hotel, food/beverage, and team building. ~US$ $136.9K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~4.0% of total (~5.1% of non-extraordinary) Physical Operations, Rent: This includes expenses related to workspace, hackathon accommodation, and maintenance. ~US$ $178.4K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~5.2% of total (~6.6% of non-extraordinary) Extraordinary: This includes fees for payment system integration efforts including Salamantex and Bluecode and continued setup of the technology and infrastructure as a service for Nimiq OASIS. An additional US$ 0.5 Mio is reserved for additional infrastructure and liquidity provision for the fiat atomic swap as OASIS is looking to expand into new markets. ~US$ $730.6K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~21.4% of total Total Use of Funds: ~US$ $3’421.5K ($2’690.9K non-extraordinary) Operational expenses related to legal, digital operations, physical operations and travel/f&b are holding reasonably steady. The monthly burn-rate as of the end of July is maintained around US$ 225K (excluding extraordinary expenses). This reflects stable team contracting expenses as well as a steady level of marketing and project visibility related expenses. Travel for hackathons and industry events picked up reasonably in line with easements of Covid-19 related restrictions. NIM supply and distribution This second part describes the distribution of NIM tokens, showing details of accounts and vesting contracts as well as the circulating and total supply as of the end of July. Quick view Live summary of NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply.txt The total final NIM supply over ~100 years by design of the Nimiq Blockchain protocol: 21'000'000'000 NIM. The circulating supply as of the end of July was ~9’620’250’000 NIM (~45.8% of final total). Details NIM activated from Token Sale NET (5% of final total): As of the end of July 2022, 861’049’052 NIM have been activated from NET and are part of the circulating supply. The remaining difference (~188’950’948 NIM) that has not been activated from NET is visible at account addresses NQ69 9A4A MB83 HXDQ 4J46 BH5R 4JFF QMA9 C3GN, NQ15 MLJN 23YB 8FBM 61TN 7LYG 2212 LVBG 4V19 and NQ17 YTX4 X5U6 5BUX HN5J V6VV 260V 9UP1 D39S. Though the deadline for activating NIM has long passed, Nimiq is processing requests on a case by case, manual basis (applying the same conditions of KYC/AML). Being conservative, Nimiq considers them part of the circulating supply. All other NIM are either acquired through mining or released through a vesting contract as further described below (all vesting durations are measured from April 14 2018). NIM minable (88% of final total): 18'480'000'000 NIM over ~100 years since April 2018. As of the end of July: ~7’670’350’000 NIM (~36.5% of final total) are part of the circulating supply.

            <description><![CDATA[The Nimiq Wallet continues to expand its feature set with the exciting new addition of USDC integration using the Polygo]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nimiq Wallet now supports USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, allowing users to send it with fee abstraction fees. The wallet uses USDC on Polygon, a scaling solution for Ethereum, for fast and cheap transactions. By processing transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum's blockchain, Polygon offers the benefits of Ethereum's security and decentralization while reducing fees and transaction times. Sending USDC usually requires MATIC, the native token of the Polygon blockchain, to cover transaction fees. To simplify this process, Nimiq’s USDC Transfer Smart Contract automatically converts a small portion of USDC into MATIC to pay for these fees, making it hassle-free for users. This way, users can enjoy the advantages of USDC without the inconvenience of managing a second token themselves. In this post, we'll take a detailed technical look at how the Nimiq Wallet's USDC integration works, using the power of the Polygon network and an innovative solution for handling transaction fees. For a visual representation of the steps involved, check out our comprehensive diagram with annotations, available here. The Nimiq Wallet's USDC integration offers a perfect balance of functionality, security, and user convenience. With this solution, you can experience the future of cryptocurrency transactions today. So, grab a cup of coffee and join us for a deep dive into the inner workings of this innovative integration. The Journey: A Step-by-Step Look at Sending USDC with Nimiq Wallet Step 1: Selecting the recipient and amount First, you select the recipient and the desired amount of USDC to send. Our system then converts the amount into the smallest unit of USDC, ensuring accurate transactions by taking into account the divisibility of cryptocurrencies. Step 2: Calculate the fee Next, we display the transaction fee, which consists of: Native transaction fee: Calculated by multiplying the gas limit (aka <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">requiredRelayGas</code> in the OpenGSN Contract) by the gas price (given by the network and the OpenGSN Relay). Amount is in MATIC. OpenGSN fee: Allows the wallet to send transactions on behalf of the user using a Relay Server. Calculated as follows:
<code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">nativeFee * (1 + pctRelayFee) + baseRelayFee</code><br/><br/>

To reduce the fee as much as possible, the Nimiq Wallet scouts different relay servers and selects the one with the lowest fees. We do this by retrieving and filtering the logs from <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">RelayServerRegistered</code> event in the Relayer Hub Contract. Amount is in MATIC. Uniswap fee: Fee for exchanging USDC to MATIC to pay the OpenGSN Relay. Paid in USDC. We cannot determine the exact amount of the fee in advance, so we use a 10% buffer as a fee. You can read more about this in step 7. We calculate the transaction fees, convert them to USDC using the MATIC-USDC exchange rate on Uniswap, and display the fee to the user prior to the transaction. The fee potentially changes with every Polygon block, so we update it regularly until the user confirms the transaction. The final fee includes an additional 10% buffer for Uniswap, which is refunded if not used. To calculate the fees, we use the Quoter Contract and Uniswap pool registered in the USDC Transfer Contract. The fee does not depend on the amount sent, so sending 1 USDC will have the same fee as sending 1,000,000 USDC. You can view the code for the function that computes the fees here.  Step 3: The user creates the request In the Nimiq Wallet, after the user confirms the transaction details, the next step is to sign it using the Nimiq Keyguard. The Keyguard acts as an intermediary between the wallet and the user's key pair, ensuring that the wallet cannot access the user's keys directly. This process is the same whether the user wants to send NIM, BTC, or USDC. Authorise USDC To transfer funds from their wallet to another wallet, the user needs to unlock their key pair with their password in the Keyguard and sign an authorization. The authorization only allows the transfer within the USDC contract on behalf of the user, but it's not the actual transfer. To create this authorization, the USDC contract requires a structured signature from the user, which is created by the Keyguard using the EIP712 standard. This standard is widely used for structuring data in Ethereum Smart Contracts and includes a domain separator, a message type, and a set of message parameters. It verifies the authenticity of the data and the signer's identity. The EIP712 signature approves the transfer of funds by signing a JSON object containing the total amount, which includes the transaction amount and fee. This authorizes the transfer of funds from one wallet to another by the transfer contract. You can find the code for signing the approval here. Open Gas Station Network v2 (OpenGSN) To transfer funds using the OpenGSN protocol, we must pay a fee for using a special message called a meta-transaction. This message allows us to send a request to the relay server, which then sends the transaction for us. The user creates a message with transaction information (including the USDC approval signed above) and sends it to the relay server. Because the relay ultimately sends the transaction, this avoids the need for MATIC for gas in the user’s wallet. The meta-transaction request contains an encoded function call called <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">transferWithApproval</code> on the transfer USDC contract. The meta-transaction is also an EIP712 structured object that is signed and has a domain field schema according to the Open GSN specification. The Keyguard creates the meta-transaction and returns it to the Wallet, which then sends it to the selected OpenGSN Relay. The code used is this one. Step 4: Sending the meta-transaction The wallet sends the meta-transaction to the relay server via an HTTPS request containing a specific body that includes the meta-transaction,as well as other relay-specific information required by OpenGSN. The code used to send the meta-transaction can be found here. Meta-transactions can be thought of as Matryoshka (nesting) dolls, with the outermost layer being the request to the OpenGSN relay. Inside this layer is an encoded function call to the <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">transferWithApproval</code> function on the Transfer USDC Contract, which acts as another layer of the doll. This function call in turn contains the necessary parameters to transfer, along with the signature that verifies the user's authorisation. On the network side, first the relay server unpacks the outermost layer and creates a transaction from its contents that interacts with the Transfer USDC Contract. The contract further unpacks the second layer, revealing the third layer, which contains the transfer amount and recipient, the arguments for the authorization function in the USDC contract, and the exchange from USDC to MATIC. Step 5: Checking requirements After the Wallet sends the meta-transaction, it goes to the <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">transferWithApproval</code> function in the Transfer USDC Contract. Before triggering the transfer, we need to check a few things to ensure that it goes through: Check that the token address exists. Check that the user has enough USDC for the amount and fee. Check that the smart contract is given permission on behalf of the user to transfer tokens.  Check that the permission amount given is enough. If any requirements are not fulfilled, the smart contract won't proceed with the transaction. You can find the smart contract code here. Step 6: Approve the transfer The USDC token is a form of digital currency that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It follows the ERC-20 standard, which outlines the rules for how the token can be moved and stored. To move USDC, we must use a secure method known as the ERC-20 approval method. This method enables someone else to move tokens on our behalf, but only with our “approval”. Step 7: Swapping USDC to MATIC To exchange USDC for MATIC, the transfer contract calls the <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">ExactOutputSingleParams</code> function on the UniSwap Smart Contract with the following parameters:: <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">tokenIn</code>: Smart Contract address of USDC. <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">tokenOut</code>: Smart Contract address of WMATIC, a 1:1 MATIC-pegged token that provides compatibility with the Ethereum virtual machine and standardisation with other ERC-20 tokens. It allows users to take advantage of decentralised EVM-based trading, DeFi protocols and applications. <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">fee</code>: The pool fee. This is a static number inherent to the pool. <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">recipient</code>: Address of the Transfer Contract. <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">amountOut</code>: The amount in MATIC to be paid for the OpenGSN and Polygon network fees. <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">amountInMaximum</code>: The maximum amount of input tokens a user is willing to spend on a trade. In our case, this value is equal to the fee calculated in step 2. Unlike traditional exchanges, UniSwap V3 does not allow for pre-calculated exchange rates. The wallet retrieves the spot-exchange rate between USDC and MATIC (WMATIC) at the time of fee estimation, but it can fluctuate rapidly due to other transactions until the transfer is made. To account for this, a 10% buffer is added to the exchange rate received in step #2. On the Mumbai Testnet network, this buffer is adjusted to 25% due to low liquidity and thus higher volatility. However, any unused buffer is refunded to the user, which is why you usually see the final fee to be lower than what was estimated. Step 8: Make the transfers The Transfer Contract now initiates two transfers. Firstly, it executes the user's requested USDC transfer by calling the <code style="background: rgba(31, 35, 72, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; padding: .1rem .3rem .2rem; border-radius: .2rem; ">transferFrom</code> function on the USDC contract, as we have previously obtained the necessary approval authorization. Secondly, the Transfer Contract unwrapps the swapped WMATIC and sends them to the OpenGSN Relay Hub to cover the cost of the native transaction fee and the fee charged by the relay. Step 9: Confirming the transaction In step #4, the wallet sent an HTTPS request to a relay server with a meta-transaction. Now, the wallet checks transaction logs to confirm the transfer. In our scenario, the relayer sends the transaction. Unlike Nimiq and Bitcoin, EVMs allow multiple token transfers in one transaction. The transaction object holds log records and shows the transaction's activity. We look for the "transfer" log which includes the user’s address as the sender, the targeted recipient, and the amount that was sent. The wallet parses these logs and restructures them into the transaction object which is then displayed in the transaction list.   Wrapping it up In conclusion, we hope that this technical blog post has provided you with a clearer understanding of how Nimiq's implementation of USDC on Polygon with Gas Abstraction works. By leveraging the advantages of the Polygon network, OpenGSN, and Uniswap, Nimiq has successfully created a user-friendly and efficient solution for sending USDC without the need for users to manage MATIC themselves.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s finally here! Through dedicated and persistent work we are excited to begin testing the release candidate for a version of The Nimiq Payment Ecosystem with Proof-of-Stake. Join us in testing it and share your feedback in the comment section of this tweet.  The Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Testnet is Finally Here! Yes. We are as excited as you are… maybe even a bit more! The Nimiq Proof-of-Stake blockchain (”consensus algorithm”) is finally ready for testing! But, before taking you to the Testing Wallet, we need to highlight a couple of basic concepts 🤓. What is a Testnet? The Nimiq Payment Ecosystem has been utilizing a 'Proof-of-Work' consensus algorithm since April 14, 2018. While Proof-of-Work was a reliable and well-researched technology at the time of Nimiq Blockchain's release, Nimiq Developers have continued to research and test innovative technologies that could benefit the ecosystem. Proof-of-Stake presents an opportunity for a consensus algorithm that can confirm transactions in less than a second, while being censorship resistant and consuming less energy. Now, let's revisit the question: What is a Testnet? A Testnet is a blockchain network utilized for testing and development purposes. It has the same codebase and rules as its corresponding Mainnet but is isolated and not meant for any real transactions or value transfers. The Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Testnet will run in parallel to the current Nimiq Network, which is running on Proof-of-Work. Developers can play with it and create their own Staking Pools, meanwhile users can try out staking in the “Testnet Wallet”. The primary goal of the Testnet is to gather valuable insights to enhance the user experience and security of the protocol, often referred to as “hardening”. This marks a new phase in Nimiq's research on Proof-of-Stake. Kudos to all developers around the world who made this possible! After research and development that stretched over the last few years, a feature-complete version of Nimiq Proof-of-Stake is ready. Some parameters still need to be finalized; therefore, aspects of the Testnet are subject to adjustments: Staking rewards Minimum stake & Validator deposit Minimum staking duration Transaction fees Penalty behaviour (slashing) Epoch & batch duration, block timing RPC & Browser client API Never send your Mainnet NIM to a Testnet Address It's important to understand that the Mainnet and Testnet are different. The Mainnet is the live production network where real transactions occur, and the NIM token has actual value. The Mainnet has real economic consequences. In contrast, the Testnet is utilized solely for testing and development purposes and could be reset unexpectedly at any time, wiping any balance or transaction history. All Nimiq supporters are welcome to test the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Testnet, but it's crucial to keep in mind that it's a Testnet, not a Mainnet. This means that the Testnet holds no real value and is subject to change. Mainnet NIM sent to a Testnet Nimiq Address could be lost forever. Let’s test out the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Testnet! Enough said! Let’s try it out. Below you can find the most common testing scenarios: Try out the Testnet Wallet! Users can access the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Testnet through the Nimiq Wallet. The Testnet is available using the following URL: wallet.pos.nimiq-testnet.com. In this Webapp, the wallet will connect to the Testnet, allowing users to try out staking and send/receive tokens on the Testnet blockchain. To begin testing, claim Testnet NIM from the faucet.  Become a Validator The documentation to become a validator can be found here. You may also join the Nimiq Developer Community. Read all the documentation below to get started. To learn more, please refer to the official GitHub repository.  Try it out in your Project! If you are looking to integrate Nimiq in your project, please refer to the client's NPM package. There is also community funding available to support anyone building with Nimiq and there are many creative community members willing to support you too!   What’s Next? We invite all community members to participate in the Testnet and provide feedback on their experience in the comment section of this tweet. Team Nimiq and the Community Developers will closely monitor the Testnet, collect data, and incorporate feedback into improvements for the staking protocol. We would like to thank Sander for his outstanding work with NIMSTATS.com, the first Nimiq Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Analyzer. A blog post with more technical details about Nimiq Proof-of-Stake will follow, but for now all eyes are on the Testnet. The Nimiq PoS Testnet is an important milestone on the path to making the Nimiq blockchain more energy efficient and increasing its speed by orders of magnitude, all the while maintaining the cornerstones of decentralization and censorship resistance. We look forward to embarking on this next phase of the Nimiq blockchain together with you. Pura Vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq turns four! Let's celebrate together with some juicy leaks.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[“love ai amor mohabbat hubun cinta lyubov bhalabasa amour kauna pi'ara liebe eshq upendo prema amore katresnan sarang anpu prema yeu” Four years ago, the first block was mined on the Nimiq Blockchain. ‘Love’ in as many languages as possible will forever be its message, see https://nimiq.watch/#1 Since then, Nimiq has grown, found fans and contributors all around the world and has succeeded in creating and shipping innovations that can bring decentralized payments to everyone. But nobody is interested in self-glorifying marketing statements so we will keep this post crisp, informative and humble – much is left to do. At the same time, there is much to celebrate: New Website On our eternal quest to improve marketing, the team is excited to release our new website. The overall structure was updated to properly represent Nimiq’s past and future developments. Most noticeably, there is more focus on our Apps. SuperSimpleSwap.com, Cryptopayment.link and of course the Nimiq Wallet are now more accessible and embedded in proper product pages that allow for professional (SEO) marketing. Overall, the design has become more mature in terms of colors and shapes. Reflecting on a more agile approach to our releases is the MVP state of the page. It currently only features the essential pages and will see regular and extensive updates in the coming weeks and months – backed by more marketing-oriented tracking. Speaking of upcoming releases... New Developer Experience Finally, a long-standing wish of the team and at least parts of the community will be fulfilled: A state-of-the-art developer experience featuring improved docs, tutorials, guides and bug bounties. While designed to support validators, OASIS implementers and blockchain beginners, it is planned to provide more transparency. Maybe even more importantly – it will feature more opportunities for the community to contribute, from wallet bug reports to Nimiq 2.0. Check out the first designs. TEN31 KYC Another longstanding request is about to be answered: Together with our partner TEN31, we are about to launch a KYC option. Once KYC’d with TEN31, you will be able to profit from higher limits for crypto-fiat swaps in the wallet, on SuperSimpleSwap.com and on all upcoming products of TEN31 and Nimiq, including the upcoming ‘Nimiq for Bluecode’ app. Still, we will never compromise on decentralization. KYC will always be optional. Registration-free access to all crucial functionality of the Nimiq payment system remains sacred. Development is largely done, legal and operational details are currently being finalized and closed testing is about to start. Cryptopayment.link V2 Nimiq’s Cryptopayment.link started as a bit of an experiment. We wanted to create a super simple way for people to accept crypto. The underlying idea was that there are many people in the world for whom investing in anything, let alone crypto, is simply impossible. These people shouldn’t be excluded from the financial revolution. Cryptopayment.link, or CPL for short, gives those people a tool to sell their services or goods for crypto, even if it’s just every once in a while. You can check the current version, it has been live for a while now and currently handles about 40 payments per day. Baby steps, but the interest is growing and various merchants approached us with ideas for improvements and features requests. We’re therefore happy to announce that V2 of CPL is likely to release still this April. It will feature a significantly faster UX, an admin dashboard and an ‘accept-only’ view to be used by staff members. As its release is just around the corner, no teasers on this one. SuperSimpleReferrals We are convinced that SuperSimpleSwap is a solution capable of conquering a significant share of the global crypto buying and selling volume. More fiat and cryptocurrencies are planned to be added, the limits are about to be raised by optional KYC sign-up and third-party integrations are becoming more tangible as the system hardens. While we continue to see overwhelming feedback and interest from potential third-party integrators when presenting it e.g. at the Blockchance conference, our basic idea for marketing is a grassroots approach. That means you, reading this article, are invited to help us spread the word. Let’s enable our peers with a way of buying and selling that doesn’t require an exchange or any other middlemen. Don’t worry, you’re not supposed to do it for free. With SuperSimpleReferrals, we offer anyone to receive a cut of the fees earned. This will be possible via referral links, a customizable widget and a properly documented API for deep integrations. A dashboard will provide analytics and data exports and even the smallest amount earned can be paid out. The backend functionality is done, the designs are ready, our frontend team will start the implementation by the end of this month. Here are some sneak peeks: Vision Workshop Every once in a while, a good hard look in the mirror is in place for every human, company, crypto project. Early this year, Nimiq did just that. In what felt like very honest, self-critical and externally supported workshops sessions, no stone was left unturned. Major changes to the current priorities, goals and structures were discussed and, in part, agreed on. It is too early to get into details, a proper update on our refreshed mission and what it means will follow in due time – at its core, however, stands interoperability. Nimiq 2.0 Probably the most complex, game-changing and anticipated upgrade for Nimiq: Nimiq 2.0. We know everybody is eager to know the launch date, we are too. Last year we were able to publish the first release candidate of the devnet. For the first time, we saw 2.0 validators running in a real network producing blocks. Amazingly, in a matter of hours, we were able to produce more blocks than the 1.0 chain has produced so far. We are getting closer by the day, improving stability and fine-tuning the operation of the Devnet Nimiq Nodes. We cannot communicate an official date until we have reached the level of stability and performance that we expect from this upgrade. To keep our supporters in the loop, we started to share frequent progress updates over our Official Twitter account. Here is a summary of the recent milestones completed: Improving stability has been the main focus in the last couple of months. While running tests on the current Nimiq 2.0 implementation, Nimiq blockchain developers found performance decreased after a certain amount of data has been processed. After solving different issues and improving the general functionality of the nodes, it became clear that a source of instability was Macro Block Creation, Database Size and Disk Usage by the nodes.  Several improvements have been made on this front, including the change from LMDB to MDBX and the creation of a non-history node. Once the nodes reached a stable state our blockchain developers began Stress Testing. This includes working on improving testing coverage and setting up a complete monitoring stack for the Nimiq 2.0 infrastructure. Also integrating an albatross stress test tool built by RedManer, a community dev (thanks!). Still, there are many bugs lurking around and we need to include functionality to prevent malicious attacks, but given the complexity of proof-of-stake blockchains, it's worth celebrating all these achievements and keep the hard work to release the 2.0 chain. Excited as we are, we need to tread lightly and keep working to reach our final go: an eco-friendly, energy-efficient and performant payment network that is ready to scale and process transactions for all of humanity! New team members Lastly, we’d like to take the opportunity to introduce and welcome our latest additions to the team: Michael is a long standing community member and joins the team as a sales representative and community manager. Roberto joins the marketing team too and will focus on partnerships, especially the onboarding of new stores to accept NIM. Maxi is a frontend developer and the latest addition to Nimiq’s tech team. His first bigger project is the new website. That’s it, the birthday update for our four-year-old. Let’s work together to help the kid grow so that it may take care of us when we’re old. Pura Vida,  Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The voting process was held using a web application that records all votes on the Nimiq Blockchain.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This adds a new usecase to Nimiq Blockchain by resulting in an easy-to-use voting platform with a high level of transparency and decentralization since all votes are public, not controlled by any single individual/entity and will be stored in the Nimiq Blockchain for posterity. The results are in for the tightly contested election for the Community Funding Board Representatives. Team Nimiq would like to thank all of the 113 members of the community who participated in the democratic process and to all the candidates who put themselves forward to represent our great community. Here is a time lapse of the voting process. The voting process was held using a web application that records all votes on the Nimiq Blockchain. The voting app was built by Community Representative Chugwig and is hosted by both Chugwig and Smitop. This adds a new usecase to the Nimiq Blockchain by resulting in an easy-to-use voting platform with a high level of transparency and decentralization since all votes are public, not controlled by any single individual/entity and will be stored in the Nimiq Blockchain for posterity. Here is a summary of the final results: With an incredible 773 million NIM being used in the voting process, the second term of the Community Funding Board sees Mat, Chugwig, and Wekkel duly elected as community representatives for the next six months. The details of the elections are below: The remaining three Board seats will be taken by Richy, Sven, and Marvin from Team Nimiq.  We’d like to give special thanks to Smitop and SirChef for their service to the Nimiq community and the Board over the last six months. Thank you for your help in laying the foundations for future Boards to support even more Nimiq community projects. Your contribution to the numerous Nimiq projects that have been supported over the last six months has been priceless.  The Meeting Both previous and current community board members were present for the latest meeting to ensure a smooth transition between boards. The following topics were discussed: What if a Board member submits a project proposal for funding? It was decided that future board members would be eligible to submit a proposal for funding. However, they would not be able to vote on it themselves due to there being a conflict of interests. To bring the number of board votes back up to six, it was decided that an alumni board member would fill the empty seat for the purposes of voting. Proactive outreach to existing Nimiq ecosystem projects. The Board agreed to increase the scope of the Community Project Funding initiative by reaching out to existing Nimiq projects to offer technical, design and funding support. It was also agreed that those who are adding value to the Nimiq ecosystem will be sought out for rewards to recognize their efforts. Small changes to future proposal submissions. The Board discussed optimizing proposal submissions and decided that the ideal proposal would start out small to begin with, and that additional funding could be requested to add more features. It was also agreed that developer rewards should not take the form of one large figure. Instead, future proposals should include milestones for suggested developer rewards. Evaluated Projects This month, two community projects were discussed: Vrimiq Project purpose: To create a Nimiq focused VR social space to bring Nimiq supporters together. VRimiq is envisioned to run directly in a browser on any device and with or without a VR-headset. Development stage: Concept. Project team: Telegram user arnputz. Previously evaluated? Yes. The Board commented that not much had changed in the proposal since it was last evaluated. It was also noted that the more detailed breakdown for costs appeared to be too high. This was particularly true of the anticipated developer rewards. After all, the idea of the Community Funding Board is to reward creators in the Nimiq ecosystem and NOT employ subcontractors. The Board requested modifications to be made. The developer reward is to be removed with a more modest reward suggested as the first step for this ambitious project. Arnputz has also been asked to outline how they envision the digital economy aspect of Vrimiq to work.  Voting Celebration Giveaway Project Purpose: To reward those that participated in the first Community Funding Board election with a NIM airdrop. Development stage: Working product. Project team: Chugwig. Previously evaluated? No. Chugwig proposed rewarding those that engaged in the latest Community Funding Board election in the following way: 1K NIM to each account that voted in the election (excluding accounts with a balance less than 5 NIM at block 679000). An extra 4000 NIM (totaling 5000 NIM) to accounts that voted in the election and the test vote. 500 NIM for accounts that participated in the test vote. The Board approved the proposal provided that the 4K extra NIM reward was removed. Instead, those who vote in the election and test vote would be rewarded with 1.5K NIM total. This means that someone who voted in the test vote with account A and someone who voted in the real vote with account B won't get less than the person who voted in both votes with account C. The Community Funding Board Wants To Help You! Are you building or operating a project in the Nimiq ecosystem and need some help?

            <description><![CDATA[A premier use case for Nimiq]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[It is Nimiq’s mission to deliver the world’s easiest-to-use, censorship-resistant payment ecosystem. In this blog post, you can discover how Nimiq is working on making it super easy for online merchants to accept crypto and receive conventional money, without using a centralized exchange or payment processor. We also explain the main problems why online merchants don’t like accepting crypto payments, and the solution that Nimiq is building to address these. Summary for the impatient This first non-custodial payment solution offers unprecedented safety against hacks Merchants get EUR into their SEPA account fast while practically eliminating the volatility risk Users get the convenience of paying with NIM, BTC & ETH as they like Why don’t online businesses accept crypto? We set out to understand why only few online merchants accept cryptocurrencies. What we learned made perfect sense to us. Online merchants have a simple problem if they accept crypto: They still have to pay their employees and suppliers in their national ‘fiat’ currencies (USD/EUR). To do that, crypto payments they accept need to be converted. Only then can they pay their employees and other expenses. This extra step costs time and money, whilst accepting crypto brings only few benefits to the merchants. We identified the following pain points for online merchants: Profit margins can get killed by crypto volatility and fees. Overnight price drops of 5% or 10% can kill any profit margin. The average profit margin of an online merchant is only between 0.5% to 3%. A sudden drop of crypto value can be particularly painful the night before payroll. The belief that crypto is unsafe. Merchants dread losing their money. Banks have to guarantee the funds they hold (more or less) and crypto payment services often come with lower levels of guarantee. While it has been ten years since people lost money in the financial crisis, reports about lost crypto funds appear on a somewhat regular basis. Is it any wonder that businesses still feel safer with traditional high street banks? Time consuming payouts. On top of the volatility, online merchants have to wait for their fiat funds to be paid out to their bank accounts. The reason are lengthy payment processes. How Nimiq solves these merchant problems The Nimiq ‘Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme’ (OASIS) is key to the solution. As a first strong use case for Nimiq we are focusing our energy on applying this framework to solving the problems of one target group: online merchants. The Nimiq OASIS framework solves online merchants’ main problem by practically eliminating the volatility risk. This happens by OASIS connecting the crypto-paying customer, the liquidity providers (such as market makers or decentralized exchanges), and the online merchants through a mechanism called the Fiat Atomic Swap. Atomic Swaps happen at a predetermined rate. They can thus secure a fixed fiat exchange rate for the merchant. Secondly, it solves the security concern. It does so by cutting out any custodial third party, e.g. a typical payment processor. This way, no intermediary ever controls the crypto and fiat, that is changing hands, in any centralized or custodial fashion. And thirdly, the Nimiq OASIS framework enables speedy payouts into the online merchant’s bank account. This is possible because the framework connects both the blockchain world and the banking system (SEPA to begin). In essence, with “Nimiq Checkout” we are building an e-commerce checkout solution that leverages the OASIS framework such that online merchants can accept crypto and get paid in conventional money at zero risk for fraud with prompt deposits into their bank accounts. How does OASIS work? Nimiq OASIS utilizes a mechanism that came to prominence in 2017. It is the basis of decentralized exchanges: the Atomic Swap. Atomic Swaps allow direct exchange with crypto currencies across blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin for Ether without the risk that comes with organizations like centralized exchanges. Eliminating the need for these organizations reduces the risk of hacks and embezzlement. In an Atomic Swap, the buyer and the seller interact through a special kind of smart contracts. This type of smart contract locks the funds of the trading partners for the intended transaction. The transaction will only execute if certain conditions are met. This lock-up allows eliminating risk associated with third-party custodians, like an exchange or payment service provider. Now, this swap mechanism works well between cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. But what if someone doesn’t want to convert between two cryptocurrencies but between a cryptocurrency and, let’s say, USD/EUR — like our online merchant? Up until now, this was impossible because conventional money can’t be locked on a blockchain. Nimiq OASIS changes this by extending the concept of Atomic Swaps to conventional currencies! This is possible by creating a smart contract that interacts with banking APIs. It creates a fiat counterpart to the crypto part of the Atomic Swap. With OASIS, online merchants can now accept crypto and receive national currency. This happens in a decentralized and safe way. It is possible to pair the sale of a cryptocurrency with the purchase of a conventional currency without the risks that come with a third party. It is like putting the Euro on the blockchain (but without a stable coin). With “Nimiq Checkout”, the online merchants will be able to accept crypto payments and receive fiat payouts (EUR to begin) with little delay and at the lowest risk. At the same time, customers can pay with crypto (NIM, BTC & ETH to begin). Both parties benefit from zero risk exposure because the exchange process can not be manipulated by a third party. This is because it is managed by smart contracts. Nimiq is currently working with WEG Bank and aims to connect a first online merchant and non-custodial liquidity provider to demonstrate the first Nimiq OASIS transactions by end of the year. Stay tuned for more updates in the future! Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[New report for the period following July 2020]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In line with the last report, we would like to present an updated overview of the assets and use of funds for the Nimiq project, as well as updated details of the distribution of NIM tokens with circulating and total supply. The period covered since the last report is August 1, 2020 through July 31, 2021. The report indicates a project growth induced increase in burn-rate as well as a significant increase in net assets due to beneficial crypto market value developments. Assets and use of funds Assets The Nimiq Project continues to hold a variety of liquid and non-liquid assets. The 9.9% stake in German TEN31 (WEG) Bank AG is valued at original participation valuation and does not reflect potential increases in such valuation. As of the end of July 2021 the Nimiq Project had the following assets: 201.9 BTC ~ US$ 8.30 Mio 2’036.4 ETH ~ US$ 4.92 Mio 101.0 Mio NIM (besides genesis NIM) ~ US$ 0.43 Mio   EUR, USD & USDC ~ US$ 6.30 Mio Stake in TEN31 (WEG) Bank ~ US$ 3.70 Mio Real Estate ~ US$ 1.10 Mio Loan to ImpactX Foundation ~US$ 33.8K  Reserves (see "Use of funds") ~ US$ (-1.81 Mio) Total Net Assets: ~US$ 22.97 Mio Use of funds The use of funds from the end of July 2020 up to the end of July 2021 breaks down as follows: Product Development Contracting, Compensations: This includes all research, design, implementation and maintenance work and consultation of third parties regarding the Nimiq protocol on its way to 2.0, the Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme (OASIS) and related apps and systems. The report indicates a reasonable growth in contracting expenses due to growth of team size and competitive compensation adjustments. An additional amount of ~US$ 260K continues to be reserved and due pending achievement of development goals (release of Nimiq 2.0, etc). ~US$ 1’662.6K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~47.1% of total (~61.6% of non-extraordinary) Marketing, Content, Community: This includes expenses related to creating and distributing marketable video and written content, branding, swag production, community rewards and influencer review fees. It also includes the membership contribution for the Blockchain for Europe organization and community programs such as the Bug Bounty Program, Community Project Funding with a reserve of US$ 50K for the next 12 months. An additional amount of US$ 50K is reserved and due pending listing related pre-staking provisions. ~US$ 542.9K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~15.4% of total (~20.1% of non-extraordinary) Legal, Administration, Taxes: This includes legal, tax and administrative expenses regarding corporate maintenance, contract review, accounting, professional support from Lara Legal Corp and additional task specific legal counseling i.e. for acquiring payment service provider licenses, trademarking, terms of services, privacy policies, etc. ~US$ 143.9K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~4.1% of total (~5.3% of non-extraordinary) Digital Operations, Equipment: This includes expenses related to hosting, hardware, software, licensing, communications, domains, and other development tools and platforms. ~US$ 126.4K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~3.6% of total (~4.7% of non-extraordinary) Travel, F&B: This includes expenses related to transportation, hotel, food/beverage, and team building. ~US$ 96.8K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~2.7% of total (~3.6% of non-extraordinary) Physical Operations, Rent: This includes expenses related to rent and maintenance. ~US$ 126.7K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~3.6% of total (~4.7% of non-extraordinary) Extraordinary: This includes the previously anticipated anti-dilution share purchase from TEN31 Bank, integration fees for payment system integration and continued setup of the technology and infrastructure as a service for Nimiq OASIS. An additional US$ 1.5 Mio is reserved for additional infrastructure and market making for the fiat atomic swap as OASIS expands into new markets. ~US$ 827.5K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~23.5% of total Total Use of Funds: ~US$ 3’526.8K ($2’699.3 non-extraordinary) Operational expenses related to legal, digital operations, physical operations and travel/f&b are holding reasonably steady in line with inflation and project growth. The monthly burn-rate as of the end of July is around US$ 225K (excluding extraordinary expenses). This reflects an increase in monthly contractor expenses due to team growth and competitive rate adjustments, as well as an increase in marketing and project visibility related expenses. Travel for hackathons was able to take place despite the circumstances and it is expected that travel for industry events will also pick up following the Covid-19 disruption. NIM supply and distribution This second part describes the distribution of NIM tokens, showing details of accounts and vesting contracts as well as the circulating and total supply as of the end of July. Quick view Live summary of NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply.txt The total final NIM supply over ~100 years by design of the Nimiq Blockchain protocol: 21'000'000'000 NIM Details NIM activated from Token Sale NET (5% of final total): As of the end of July 2021, 855’097’617 NIM have been activated from NET and are part of the circulating supply. The remaining difference (~194’902’382 NIM) that has not been activated from NET is visible at account addresses NQ69 9A4A MB83 HXDQ 4J46 BH5R 4JFF QMA9 C3GN and NQ15 MLJN 23YB 8FBM 61TN 7LYG 2212 LVBG 4V19. Though the deadline for activating NIM has long passed, Nimiq is processing requests on a case by case, manual basis (applying the same conditions of KYC/AML). Being conservative, Nimiq considers them part of the circulating supply. All other NIM are either acquired through mining or released through a vesting contract (all vesting durations are measured from April 14 2018). NIM minable (88% of final total): 18'480'000'000 NIM over ~100 years since April 2018. As of the end of July: 6’240’467’109 NIM (~29.7% of final total) are part of the circulating supply. The live amount mined to date is available here: http://nim.sh/stats/supply/mined/nim.txt Nimiq Foundation (Project, 2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ09 VF5Y 1PKV MRM4 5LE1 55KV P6R2 GXYJ XYQF. Vesting is 26'250'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 157’500’000 NIM are part of the circulating supply. These funds have not been touched. ImpactX Foundation (Charity, 2% of final total): 420'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ19 YG54 46TX EHGQ D2R2 V8XA JX84 UFG0 S0MC. Vesting is 21'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 126’000’000 NIM are part of the circulating supply. These funds have not yet been touched. In June a 1 BTC (US$ 33’780) donation was made to the charity:water’s bitcoin trust with an interest rate free loan from Nimiq to the ImpactX Foundation. Nimiq Team & Early Contributors (2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at 82 vesting contract addresses, see https://pastebin.com/raw/1eDwDF45. Vesting schedule A (for creators) was 35'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 3 years and vesting schedule B was 157'500'000 NIM month 3 and month 6 (team, early contributors and future team member allocation).

            <description><![CDATA[Strategic partnership strengthened for Nimiq OASIS]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Team Nimiq is excited to announce that the project has recently acquired a 9.9% stake in German WEG Bank AG. This acquisition further solidifies the strategic partnership between Nimiq and WEG Bank on Nimiq OASIS (Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme), a potentially revolutionary crypto-to-fiat bridge. This unique blueprint, for a fast and easy way to buy or sell cryptocurrency for fiat currency, aims to initially connect a) different cryptocurrencies markets — via non-custodial liquidity providers or exchanges such as Agora.Trade, to b) the traditional banking network — via WEG Bank. Value transfers between the two worlds are enabled by Nimiq OASIS making money in fiat bank accounts “blockchain compatible”. Furthermore, Nimiq OASIS enables the processing of value transfers without a single, centralized intermediary (like an exchange or payment processor) controlling the two assets being exchanged, and without the need to entrust the private keys of the crypto asset to a third party. An acquisition & partnership with substance As a result of this partnership and acquisition, Nimiq OASIS can leverage the SEPA Instant banking network through WEG Bank. This means that the combination of Nimiq OASIS, a non-custodial liquidity provider such as Agora.Trade and WEG Bank could enable customers at any of the 2'000+ banks in the SEPA Instant network to exchange value between crypto and fiat systems. The SEPA Instant network currently connects the majority of EU countries including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. To conclude this means that crypto-to-fiat swaps for NIM | BTC | ETH, powered by Nimiq OASIS, could become available to SEPA Instant banking customers in 20 countries by the end of 2019 which is the targeted rollout time. The acquisition of a stake in WEG Bank and collaboration on Nimiq OASIS also opens up the possibility of other key prospective partnerships. Both Litecoin and TokenPay are existing shareholders and WEG Bank is currently selecting twenty cryptocurrency projects for corporate accounts with the bank this year, with Lisk being the first project announced. Its existing stable real estate banking business gives it the stability it needs, while thoughtful expansion into the crypto space sets the stage for modern growth and innovation. Having this tie to recognized cryptocurrency projects via Nimiq’s stake in WEG Bank, could open up additional opportunities and partnerships. Synergies Recently, Team Nimiq announced NIM integration with the Binance-owned TrustWallet and we are delighted to report that founder Viktor Radchenko is already expressing a deep interest in potential Nimiq OASIS integration. Team Nimiq’s vision beyond a first implementation, is to further expand the reach of Nimiq OASIS to other countries outside of the SEPA Instant network, add support for additional fiat currencies like the USD and additional crypto assets. Excited about the WEG Bank acquisition and what it means for Nimiq OASIS? Learn more about the solution in our previous blog post. Team Nimiq would like to thank our amazing community for joining us on this journey. Together we can reimagine what a cryptocurrency payment system should be and help create the solutions for its wider adoption. Pura Vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Community Infrastructure, Bounties and MVPs in May]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[While COVID-19 is keeping the world in suspense, Nimiq Community continues building and the Funding Board keeps finding ways to give support. Let’s dig into the details of the May Meeting. Community Infrastructure The first topic brought up for discussion was the possibility of having server infrastructure maintained by the community where community developers could test out their app fast and easy. Team Nimiq is doing coding Webinars like the recent one where coders learned how to use the Nimiq Starter Kit. The Starter Kit provides developers with all the dependency commonly used in Nimiq-ecosystem projects so they can get building a project in no-time. For a while now, the community funding proposals have requested server cost funding, at the same time, the Funding Board has discussed how to better deal with server costs.  The Nimiq Starter Kit makes it easy for a developer to try out her/his project in a confined environment. Combining it with an easy way to spin up a new testing server could lower the barriers for coders to publicly try out their apps. The decision was to take advantage of the situation that we currently have two experienced developers with strong backgrounds in server infrastructure as Community Representatives in the Funding Board. Maestro and Vasconcelos will join efforts with members of Team Nimiq to design and implement such an infrastructure. Technical discussions were taken offline and the next steps are to be discussed in the meeting in June. There were also some concerns about funding servers for projects that create revenue. The decision was to offer the infrastructure service only to coders who are working on not-for-profit projects. It was also agreed that it is important to have well-defined guidelines for such a service. Bounties Members of Team Nimiq shared their interest in adding more bounties to the community funding section of the Nimiq website. This is a good way to share ideas with developers from the community while at the same time improving the projects in areas where the team could use the contribution of the community. No specific bounties were shared yet, but keep an eye on nimiq.com and the social media channels, we will let you know about new bounties. May MVPs Here are the projects that were rewarded in May! From now on we will have a list of all rewarded developers and projects on this forum thread and share the latest additions in upcoming Community Funding reports. Stefan for Nimtris If you haven’t played Nimtris yet, then take a look at this fun and addictive game. It was created as a fork from an open source game. Stefan, the creator of Nimtris, integrated Nimiq into the game and turned it into a faucet with a fun factor! What’s cool about it is that everything is completely browser-based. Stefan received 75k NIM rewards for the integration of the Nimiq Hub into the game, 50k for his work and 25k as an extra for the value that the documentation brings to Nimiq coders. Paul Gertz for Nimiq Video Game Store This month gamers were delighted to be able to buy video games directly with NIM. Paul has not only set up this amazing Store, but also constantly created promotions and campaigns on his own twitter account. He has received 25k NIM for the effort so far and the value it provides for the community. Further rewards are considered for the future in case he decides to open source the website. Shay for Nimiq Shilling If you are active on Telegram or Twitter, you probably have seen Shay. He is one of the loudest, most active community members! You can see him often shilling Nimiq, telling people about it on twitter and creating contests. He is not sponsored by the project at the moment, so all his efforts are out of pure love for Nimiq. The funding board thinks that, even though his tone is sometimes a bit on the hard-sell side, his contributions are very valuable as we are in a phase of the project where Nimiq can use more visibility. The funding board appreciates the efforts of Shay and rewards him 20k NIM. Moar Proposals The last topic discussed was the lack of proposals and how this could be related to the imminent release of a Devnet for Nimiq Albatross. The Devnet will allow developers to connect to a testing network of Albatross and develop their projects there. Even though Team Nimiq will try to have a smooth transition to Nimiq 2.0 and be backwards compatible, it is clear from the Nimiq Coders that they are waiting for the Devnet to then start working on what will be the future of Nimiq. From the point of view of the funding board, it makes sense to prepare an infrastructure that allows building apps on the Devnet easily and to also continue providing bounties to steer the efforts of the coding community. Nimiq Coders are eager to start working on projects for Albatross and we want to give them the tools to easily create and quickly try out new ideas. As always, remember to visit the Nimiq Forum and share ideas for Nimiq projects you would like to see come to life. Also, make sure you check out the recently released OASIS infosite. Nimiq OASIS is open technology and a potential tool for developers to build on top of. Until the next one, Nimiq Community Funding Board]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[More ways to store your NIM]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Team Nimiq would like to extend special thanks to Terorie and Vasconcelos, both members of the Nimiq community, for their instrumental help in spearheading this new collaboration with Trust Wallet. Why collaborate with a multi-crypto wallet? It’s no secret that the cryptocurrency universe is diverse and that many crypto holders own many different cryptocurrencies. Before multi-coin wallets like Trust Wallet, a crypto user might have to set up many different wallets to store their cryptocurrencies. This is not only time consuming but can be confusing, putting off many new potential crypto adopters. There is nothing that can contribute to the mass adoption of cryptocurrency more than simplification and making crypto easy to use. Without this, crypto is unlikely to ever be mass adopted by the average person. An important step to achieve mass adoption and expand the crypto user-base is by making cryptocurrency more accessible to less tech-savvy users. Multi-coin wallets have already made a big contribution in increasing cryptos ease-of-use by enabling your typical user to easily store and track different crypto assets all in a single place. Both Nimiq and Trust Wallet share a vision of simplifying cryptocurrency and there are a few reasons behind Nimiq pursuing this mutually beneficial collaboration. The community lead effort spearheaded by Terorie and Vasconcelos has empowered NIM holders by providing another great and convenient way to store tokens securely. Trust Wallet will also be the first mobile app to support NIM and enables Nimiq supporters to easily use NIM on the go. Nimiq is set to integrate the NIM faucet into the Trust Wallet multi-crypto app so that users can experience the simplicity of NIM for free. Adding NIM to the fastest growing multi-coin wallet increases the visibility and reach of Nimiq in the cryptocurrency community. Opens the door for research collaboration opportunities between the two projects. What does Nimiq bring to the table? Trust Wallet founder Viktor Radchenko is excited about this new collaboration and recognizes Nimiq’s great potential. Integrating NIM as a supported crypto asset continues Trust Wallet’s trend of only supporting high-quality cryptocurrencies and the app is set to benefit from an increase in users from Nimiq’s rapidly growing community. The integration of the Nimiq faucet is also set to expand Trust Wallet’s growing range of features. Viktor has also expressed a deep interest in Nimiq’s groundbreaking blueprint for the crypto-to-fiat bridge Nimiq OASIS which is being developed in collaboration with WEG Bank AG and Agora.Trade. This could potentially enable Trust Wallet to accept fiat currency deposits and withdrawals in the future. The disruptive potential of Nimiq OASIS lies in the solution being able to empower users to buy or sell crypto without: A centralized intermediary ever controlling the two assets being swapped. The private keys of the crypto asset ever leaving the owners possession. Nimiq OASIS is scheduled to go live in Q4 2019 and could add additional features to Trust Wallet whilst eliminating the need for a payment processor and the fees associated. More on Nimiq OASIS can be found in our previous blog post. NIM token integration into Trust Wallet went live on March 27, 2019. About Trust Wallet Trust Wallet is one of the most popular multi crypto wallets for Android and iOS devices. The wallet was acquired by Binance on July 31st, 2018 and is now fully integrated into the Binance DEX. Trust Wallet also supports staking, a DApp browser and marketplace, enabling users to buy and sell digital assets like a CryptoKitty. Two million NIM giveaway To celebrate NIM’s integration into Trust Wallet, Nimiq will hold a special giveaway of 1’000 NIM to the first 1’000 new users who download the Trust Wallet app, add NIM support to their wallet and claim them. Thereafter, 100 NIM will be given away to an additional 10’000 new users. The start of the promotion and more details on how to claim will be announced on Nimiq’s Twitter account. By the community, for the community We would like to give many thanks and credit to Nimiq community members Terorie (Germany) and Vasconcelos (Brazil) who are responsible for the majority of the development efforts on Trust Wallet integration. If you’re a developer new to Nimiq and want to join a rapidly growing multi-national community filled with highly skilled developers, then consider submitting a proposal to participate in our Community Project Funding initiative. Maybe you’ll be lucky enough to even collaborate with Vasconcelos and Terorie. Finally, the Nimiq Team would like to thank everyone in the Nimiq community for your amazing support. We are more dedicated than ever to expanding the Nimiq ecosystem and forging meaningful collaborations and partnerships with projects that share our ethos and values. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[NIM and BTC can now be bought directly by bank transfer.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Almost four years ago, Nimiq was founded with a clear-cut goal in mind: Make crypto easy and available to everyone. One fundamental aspect was the in-and-out of crypto. Without an easy way to buy and sell the new internet money, there would be no mass adoption.  We are now excited to present the result of years of original research, development, and regulatory finesse: Nimiq OASIS is finally here!  Someone entirely new to crypto can create a wallet and buy NIM and BTC directly from their bank account:  In under five minutes Without registration At only 1,25% fees  Public Beta: What’s ready and what’s coming soon While the team is enthusiastic about the release, let’s have a look at what just became available and what is yet to come.  One thing upfront: Beta does not mean that a user is at any risk of losing funds. Using it is completely safe (see "A word on the Tech" below). Initially, only buying crypto is available. Selling will be released in the coming weeks. Through the partnership with German TEN31 Bank, the first instance of OASIS supports Euro for any SEPA Instant capable bank accounts. And already, the first addition is underway: Nimiq is paving the way for OASIS Latin America, with the setup and integration of a Costa Rican payment service provider. Perspectively, we aim to extend OASIS to support every major currency.  Right now, users need a European bank account that supports instant transactions. This standard is widely supported already. Banks still missing it are likely to implement it in the near future.    Buying, selling and also swapping cryptocurrencies is initially limited to 500$ (~400€) per transaction and 1000$ (~800€ ) per 30 days rolling window. Increases to these limits may become available going forward, but will likely require additional authentication (KYC). While supporting larger swaps is certainly on our roadmap, we believe current limits to already enable most individuals to participate in the cryptoverse.  On the crypto side, buying NIM and BTC is supported. We plan to support other crypto currencies like ETH or LTC for usage outside the Nimiq Wallet. The public beta is fast already but will see great improvements in the future. For NIM swaps, Nimiq 2.0 will be the most significant upgrade of transaction speed. On the banking side, more optimized APIs are expected to have a considerable impact as well, reducing time spent waiting for EUR transactions to register.  A quick look at the entities involved Buying and selling crypto with EUR is enabled not by one entity, but by the interplay of three main actors. Here’s a small run-down of who does what. Nimiq OASIS is the underlying protocol and the actual innovation. It simulates blockchain behavior for off-chain assets. When implemented into – for example – a Euro bank, Euro becomes programmable. This is essential for non-custodial buying and selling since it allows something entirely new: Euro smart contracts. TEN31 Bank is a fully licensed German Bank of which Nimiq is a shareholder. It is the first entity to implement the protocol and offer an OASIS instance for Euro. Whereas the blockchain executes a crypto smart contract, the bank executes the fiat smart contract. Whereas the blockchain executes a crypto smart contract, the bank - as the highest form of reliability in fiat - executes the fiat smart contract. Fastspot is a liquidity service created by Nimiq that is necessary for delivering a good user experience. Atomic fiat-crypto swaps would be possible without it, but who will sell to you at the exact moment you want to buy? Fastspot provides liquidity and sets up the verifiable smart contracts for the Atomic Swap. A word on the tech For a more detailed explanation, we recommend checking out nimiq.com/oasis. In short, the system is inspired by the established concept of Atomic Swaps and Hashed Timelock Contracts (or HTLCs for short).  HTLCs are specialized smart contracts that, once funded, can only do one of two things:  They release their funds to a specific address once a condition is met; or They return their funds to where they were sent from after a preset time expires The condition for 1) is the creation and funding of a mirroring contract. While this is not new for crypto in general, the innovation lies in enabling fiat-funded HTLCs, thus allowing crypto-to-fiat Atomic Swaps. A NIM HTLC and an EUR HTLC can now be interlinked. The assets can be swapped without any central entity ever holding them at the same time. Additionally, such swaps are super secure since the worst-case scenario for any involved party is simply getting their asset back (as explained in point 2).  The Fees - or “How NIM holders will profit”  As initially stated, we deem this solution to not only benefit Nimiq, but cryptocurrencies in general. OASIS is not inherently connected to NIM as a coin or the Nimiq ecosystem in general.  To create a direct link between OASIS based solutions and NIM, all of OASIS’ profits will be used to buy NIM. This is expected to increase the scarcity and create demand that will increase with OASIS’s usage.  The initial fees will be 1% for OASIS and 0,25% to cover Fastspot’s operating costs. Keep in mind that, since we are talking about actually moving coins on-chain, network fees apply as well.  This is just the beginning Nimiq now has technology at hand that can be leveraged way beyond the wallet. To allow as many users as possible to profit from the easiest way in and out of crypto, Nimiq aims to roll out a range of services and products based on OASIS.  Here’s an incomplete list of what we envision:  A standalone service: A straightforward solution to buy and sell with any wallet.  A widget and API: Fastspot will provide solutions to implement atomic swapping, buying and selling into any product. Checkout and Ecommerce services: With OASIS, businesses will be able to accept crypto while receiving fiat. We would like to thank all Nimiq supporters for your patience and trust in the project. More than ever we are committed to making cryptocurrency easy and available to everyone. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week Max and I went to Vienna with one goal: to try out the Salamantex payment terminals and finally pay with NIM in a physical shop. So we went.  First, we booked two rooms in the Hotel Vienna, also known as the Kryptohotel. Can we pay for the entire stay with NIM? The hotel owner Mr. Lerch replied: Yes, we can! So we packed up: business cards, Nimiq swag, recording gear and left for Vienna. First payment experience To prepare for our work, Max and I met in the bar of the hotel and had a cup of coffee. That’s how we met the hotel owner for the first time and we asked: can we also pay for the coffee in NIM?? Sure! So we got our gear, set up microphone and camera and were ready to pay with NIM in a physical shop for the first time EVER! We got excited. :) And it worked! The hotel owner entered the amount to be paid, the terminal showed a QR code, Max scanned it, confirmed the transaction on his mobile and seconds later, a printed receipt appeared from the little machine. Payment successful! We were super happy! It’s an incredible and hard-to-explain feeling to see years of hard work finally coming to fruition: we paid with NIM as conveniently as if it was a credit card payment. Nimiq pizza day Hyped with this great experience, we went to a cafe and a pharmacy in town.  Cafe 42 was our next stop. The owner was equally curious about crypto, so we talked about Nimiq, our ambitions, the vision, and future goals. The owner being such a crypto enthusiast, we were all excited to pay in NIM for the delicious pizza, salad, and soup we got. That made it the first Nimiq Pizza Day in history, but not by manually exchanging NIM for a pizza, but by actually paying directly with NIM in the shop! Maybe it will become a costly pizza in the future, but it was well worth it. Back to topic. While the hotel owner had a payment terminal custom-made by Salamantex, the small restaurant owner was using thegeneric Ingenico payment terminal— typically used for credit card payments. He was happy to walk us through the entire process, and we happily recorded everything.Ingenico terminalsare especially interesting becausethousands of them are in use alreadyand the Salamantex software can be added to make them crypto-enabled without the shop owner needing to buy and learn a new device. That means, step by step, Salamantex will roll out the software plugin on the Ingenico payment terminalsfirst inAustria, then Germany, and then throughout Europe!There is no definite deadline, but the process started with the rollout in Austria. Moving on, we went to the pharmacy Troststraße U1 owned by a crypto enthusiast that was happy to have us come and buy something trying out the Salamantex terminal. Also, that went smoothly, and we got three organic bamboo toothbrushes that we want to give to you. If you want to win a bamboo toothbrush together with an original Nimiq-branded Ledger Nano S, follow @Nimiq on Twitter and share this blog post using the hashtag #NIMonSALAMANTEX. We’ll pick three lucky winners. Pay with NIM and join the raffle I’ve been looking forward to paying with NIM in shops for a long time and now it finally happened! And I didn’t expect the experience to be so mind-blowing — I think there’s no better way to explain it than with this photo of Max being happy. The crypto revolution is arriving, we’re writing history! Thank you for being on this journey, the sky's the limit! Join the revolution, pay with NIM in Austria and post your bill on Twitter for a chance to get your purchase paid by Nimiq. Pura Vida,  Sven and Max]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Transparency Report up to July 2018]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[To provide a high degree of transparency to the Nimiq community, we would like to present an overview of the assets and use of funds for the Nimiq project as of July 31 2018, as well as details of the distribution of NIM tokens with circulating and total supply. Assets and use of funds At closing of the NET token creation event (July 9 2017) a total of 56.5K ETH were received from contributions (60K ETH minus creation event costs), the approximate equivalent of US$12.8 Mio at the time. Following professional advice during this highly volatile period with the market in steep decline (ETH had peaked out at US$400/ETH on June 11 and was down over 50% below $200 levels on July 10, going as low as US$140 in the days that followed), we sought to convert and diversify funds swiftly resulting in holding around 30% of funds in BTC, 20% in ETH and 50% in fiat (mostly US$). Assets The Nimiq Project has a variety of assets. Since the initial diversification additional investments were made, including the acquisition of a property intended to provide diversification of assets held and grounds for a potential future Nimiq Campus. As of end of July 2018 the Nimiq Project has the following assets (valued earlier on day of this publication): 724.7 BTC ~ US$4.53 Mio 9’470.5 ETH ~ US$1.61 Mio Fiat (EUR, USD) ~ US$5.08 Mio Real Estate ~ US$1.1 Mio Total Assets: ~US$12.32 Mio Use of funds The use of funds since project inception early 2017 up to the end of July 2018 breaks down as follows: Contracting, Compensations: This includes all development, design, code audits (Smart Contracts, Genesis & Mainnent Launch Code) and efforts of the team, Y Media Labs, Overnice GbR, Backes SRT GmbH and additionally contracted individuals. ~US$2.039 Mio in crypto ~US$80.4K in fiat Subtotal US$2’119.4K, ~46% Legal, Administration: This includes legal and administrative expenses regarding NET creation, activation of NIM, corporate structuring and restructuring, accounting, professional KYC and AML support from MME Legal | Tax | Compliance, Lara Legal Corp, Sielva Management, Jumio Corp, Intrum Justitia et al. ~US$235K in crypto ~US$115.8K in fiat Subtotal US$350.8K, ~7.6% Marketing, Listings, Content, Community: This includes expenses related to creating marketable video and written content, branding, listing integration fees, ledger co-branding & promotion, swag production, and community rewards. It also includes community programs such as the Hackerone Bug Bounty Program (of which unused balance is refundable) and the sponsorship of PhD Blockchain Research at Imperial College in London. ~US$995.9K in crypto ~US$18K in fiat Subtotal US$1’013.9K, ~22% Digital Operations, Equipment: This includes expenses related to hosting, hardware, software, licensing, and other development tools and platforms. ~US$201.4K in crypto ~US$37.6K in fiat Subtotal US$239K, ~5.2% Travel, F&B, Fitness: This includes expenses related to transportation (air, ground, water), hotel, food & beverage, health & fitness and team building. ~US$185.9K in crypto ~US$365.7K in fiat Subtotal US$551.6K, ~12% Physical Operations, Rent: This includes expenses related to rent, maintenance, and campus development. ~US$77.2K in crypto ~US$253K in fiat Subtotal US$330.2K, ~7.2% Total Use of Funds: ~US$4’604.9K The monthly burn rate excluding one-time, irregular travel and short-term contract expenses end of July was around US$245K. NIM supply and distribution In this second part we would like to describe the distribution of NIM tokens, indicating details of accounts and vesting contracts as well as circulating and total supply as of end of July. Quick view Live summary of NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply.txt Just the current circulating NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply/circulating/nim.txt The total final NIM supply in ~100 years by design of the Nimiq Blockchain protocol: 21'000'000'000 NIM Details In the context of raising ETH contributions through the NET token creation in June 2017, a total of 10'500'000 NET Token (ERC20 Token) were created and held by contributors. No additional NET were ever held or controlled by the team. The NIM token (native token of the Nimiq Blockchain) followed this creation process: For each NET burned by a NET holder in the activation process he/she receives 100 NIM. Therefore up to 1'050'000'000 NIM are being activated from NET holders. NIM activated from NET as of July 31 2018 amount to 712'315'677 NIM and are part of the circulating supply. The remaining difference (~337'684'323 NIM) to be activated from NET is visible at account addresses NQ69 9A4A MB83 HXDQ 4J46 BH5R 4JFF QMA9 C3GN and NQ15 MLJN 23YB 8FBM 61TN 7LYG 2212 LVBG 4V19. Since these NIM can be activated at any moment from remaining NET token holders, we also consider them part of the circulating supply. Reminder: The deadline for activating NIM from NET is October 14 2018, 11:59 pm UTC-12. After this time Activation of NIM from NET will no longer be supported. This also means that NET will no longer be associated with the utility of the Token of the Nimiq Blockchain. The plan is to immutably stop the NET contract some short time after the Activation deadline. All other NIM are either acquired through mining or released through a vesting contract (all vesting durations are measured from April 14 2018). NIM minable (88% of final total): 18'480'000'000 NIM NIM mined as of end of July (~3% of final total): ~647'623'990 NIM, part of circulating supply. The live amount is available here: http://nim.sh/stats/supply/mined/nim.txt Nimiq Foundation (Project, 2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ09 VF5Y 1PKV MRM4 5LE1 55KV P6R2 GXYJ XYQF. Vesting is 26'250'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting is in October 2018, so nothing from this amount is yet part of the circulating supply. ImpactX Foundation (Charity, 2% of final total): 420'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ19 YG54 46TX EHGQ D2R2 V8XA JX84 UFG0 S0MC. Vesting is 21'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting is in October 2018, so nothing from this amount is yet part of the circulating supply. Nimiq Team & Early Contributors (2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM (of which 114'420'444 NIM for future team member & development allocation) at 82 vesting contract addresses, see https://pastebin.com/raw/1eDwDF45. Vesting schedule A (for creators) is 35'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 3 years and vesting schedule B is 157'500'000 NIM month 3 and month 6 (team, early contributors and future team member allocation). First vesting was July 14 2018 so 157'500'000 NIM are part of the circulating supply. Recommended Block Explorer for Account and Contract Addresses: https://nimiq.watch]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Preparing Nimiq Community Project Funding]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq is passionate about being inclusive and empowering people to make a difference. We know many of you in the community have amazing ideas that could add real value to the Nimiq ecosystem. However, a great idea is one thing and we understand that most of the time initial funding is needed to get it off the ground. That’s why Team Nimiq is proposing to support Nimiq community projects and help turn these visions into reality. The idea of this post is to share the basic cornerstones of the envisioned process including how a decision-making board would be structured and elected, what a project proposal should contain, and how it would be reviewed. As soon as the details have been finalized, a follow-up will be published here with all the details on how to submit your proposal, how to vote, and the details on the decision processes in and around the board. To get this initiative off the ground, we are looking for three members of the Nimiq community to become participants at board level representing the community’s interests. How will the Nimiq community funding work? The Nimiq team proposes: Setting up the “Community Funding Board”: Made up of six members: Three from the Nimiq team & three community representatives. Project funding proposals will be granted if more than 50% of the board accept the funding proposal. Submitting “Community Funding Proposals”: These can be submitted by anyone in the Nimiq community. What’s expected of board members? Each community funding board member will have responsibilities and you should agree to meet all obligations before putting yourself forward as a candidate for the Community Funding Board: There will be a six-month commitment and all board members must fulfill their full term. Board meetings will be held monthly via conference call. Time will be required one week before each meeting to generate and agree upon the meeting agenda. You will be required to engage with the Nimiq community in matters related to funding proposals. After your term on the board, you will be expected to help your successor transition into their new role. To ensure that board members are taking on the position for the right reasons, all board members are asked to participate on a voluntary, pro bono basis, without compensation. How can you get on the board? Three seats are to be made up of elected Nimiq community representatives and anyone can put themselves forward for these board seats. The community will then vote to elect three representatives. So, how does the voting work? Votes are cast by NIM holders and are weighted by their NIM balances. The three most popular community representatives would be assigned the board seats. As all members of the community are important to the project as a whole, the decision on weighting the votes by NIM holdings was not an easy one. But it is based on two thoughts: first, individuals heavily committed to Nimiq have a natural interest in the project’s success and second it is also the best way to protect the voting system against malicious intent. It is important to note that board membership is not limited to people that are holding NIM, this limitation applies only to those who can vote for them. To not delay the board from starting to support projects, an ad hoc solution will be in place for selecting community representatives for the first round of board elections. To counterbalance this, the first term might be shorter than six-month. What are the advantages of being a board member? The opportunity is to play a vital role in community project funding decisions. The choices you make have the potential to shape the future of the Nimiq project and ecosystem. You’ll also gain first-hand experience in participating in a cryptocurrency project and may be exposed to some of the most cutting-edge ideas in the crypto space. We can also assure that you will meet enthusiastic people who believe in the principles of freedom, outstanding UX, decentralization, positive environmental, and social impact. If that sounds interesting and you can commit, then please do put yourself forward as a candidate for the Community Funding Board. How can you propose your project? When working on a proposal, keep the fundamental question in mind that the board has to answer when reviewing it on behalf of the community: How it will contribute to NIM adoption and the growth of the Nimiq community in general? Therefore the board needs an overall perspective on your project including a title and description, who is participating and why/how they are qualified to do so. Followed by details on whether the project is going to be open source, decentralized, and distributable are required together with a detailed project plan including schedule, target audience, and use of funds. Finally summarize the funding needs with a suggested access schedule (milestone unlock), as well as any information about other past or future external funding. Please note: due to legal aspects, all funding will be in crypto; Nimiq foundation should get stake if a company is set up by those who received funding. How does a project get accepted? It’s a three step process taking place once a month: Community vote: One up/down vote per user per project. Measures against vote spamming will be put in place. (Captcha, Nimiq account, …) Public announcement: The highest voted projects will be announced at least one week before the board meeting so that the community can voice their thoughts and opinions. Board meeting: Guided by the community votes and feedback, the board will decide which projects proposals to accept or reject, or if changes need to be made. All final decisions will come with feedback. PLEASE NOTE: Team Nimiq is currently working on finalizing the details. If you think you already have a strong reason to apply for funding before we deploy the whole process we are happy to hear your feedback on Discord or directly via sven@nimiq.com. A follow-up post with precise details on what a proposal needs to contain, criteria of the board’s decision process, funding possibilities as well as limitations will be published soon. The entire team is very excited about the Nimiq Community Project Funding and curious to see, review, and finally support projects of our community members! Happy hacking! Follow Nimiq on Twitter, Discord and Telegram to be notified about updates on projects and apps of the Nimiq Ecosystem.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Team Nimiq is proud to present Albatross, the outcome of our research collaboration with Trinkler Software. Albatross is a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm that is able to achieve a performance close to the theoretical maximum for single-chain Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithms. While a technical description of the protocol has been published, this blog post strives for a lighter and easy-to-understand overview. It is important to stress that Albatross is a consensus algorithm only. As such, it does not define the functionality built on top of it, but is only a single building block of a blockchain protocol. While Nimiq is evaluating the use of Albatross for its next generation protocol, no decisions have been made. More details about our plans for Albatross are available at the end of this post. What is Proof-of-Stake? In a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based consensus algorithm, the node eligible to append the next block is chosen proportional to the stake it has in the system. That makes block production very cheap compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW) based algorithms. Misbehavior (e.g. in the form of forks) is often punished by slashing the stake of the misbehaving node and burning or redistributing it. The three most important benefits of PoS over PoW are: a drastically reduced energy consumption: there is no need to perform labor that is highly energy consuming to secure the blockchain, reduced risk of centralization: specifically, economies of scale are less of an issue in PoS, and the equivalent of 51% attacks being more expensive: misbehaving nodes permanently lose their stake, compared to reusable hardware in PoW. What does “optimistic consensus algorithm” mean? We describe Albatross — our novel blockchain consensus algorithm — to be optimistic. This term does not mean that we sacrifice any security but means that it is inspired by speculative Byzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) algorithms. Classical BFT algorithms provide consensus in distributed systems while considering a limited number of malicious or Byzantine actors. One of the most prominent examples of such an algorithm is PBFT, which, e.g., the Tendermint cryptocurrency is leveraging at its core. Speculative BFT algorithms are an advancement over standard BFT algorithms. They allow for drastic performance increases in the case of no malicious actors being present. This is the so-called optimistic case and where our description finds its origin. In case Byzantine actors are present and try tampering with the protocol, others can notice and switch the protocol into its slower and more conservative mode, offering the same security guarantees as standard BFT protocols. Hence, in the best case, optimistic consensus algorithms are able to perform much better than classical ones. During an attack case, optimistic algorithms still have a performance similar to standard ones. The Albatross protocol In Albatross, those nodes that are responsible for producing new blocks are called validators. Anyone who has a stake in the system can volunteer as a validator by depositing his/her stake as security that can be slashed. Block production in Albatross is divided into epochs. As the following figure shows, each epoch consists of a constant number of micro blocks (four micro blocks in the example below) followed by a macro block. Micro blocks contain the transactions and have a single block producer that is randomly chosen from the validators. While anyone can volunteer to be a validator, the actual set of validators in a given epoch (the active validators) is chosen by the macro block of the preceding epoch. In our example, block number 0 determines the active validators v_0,…,v_k for the epoch from block 1 to block 5. To be able to randomly choose the next block producer from the list of validators, each block contains a random beacon, depicted above by r_i. The block producer of a block uses a so-called Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to produce the next random value r_i from the previous value r_{i-1}. Every other participant can then verify the correctness of the next random value. Given these random beacons in each block, every participant of Albatross is then able to determine the next block producer v_{σ(r)} from the list of active validators. The production of micro blocks is thus as simple as the selected block producer putting transactions into a block, signing the block cryptographically, and sending the block to the network. The production of macro blocks is a bit more involved but happens much more rarely. Macro blocks are built using the classical PBFT protocol. To this end, the chosen block producer — or in this case rather a proposer — constructs the next random value and, from this value, determines the new list of active validators for the next epoch. The list of validators is chosen from all volunteers weighed by their stake and based on the random beacon. The block proposer then publishes its proposal, and all other active validators vote on it in two rounds. Macro blocks do not contain any transactions. There is no notion of targeted block time between blocks, and thus blocks can be produced almost as fast as the network allows. While the explanation above only covers the optimistic case, the protocol remains secure under the assumption of at most ⅓ of the validator list being Byzantine actors. These actors, however, can temporarily slow the chain and put block production into the more conservative mode. Byzantine actors can mainly trigger two mechanisms: (1) forks, which cause the next block producer to pick one of the conflicting blocks and allow validators to slash the malicious validator’s stake, and (2) delays, which cause another validator to produce the block instead. A more detailed explanation of these cases can be found in the technical paper. Consistency vs. availability An interesting trade-off to make when designing such a protocol is the one between consistency and availability. Consistency describes the property that all participants of the protocol agree on the same, most recent value. Availability describes the property that participants cannot be stopped from learning the correct, most recent value indefinitely. The CAP theorem now states that, during a network partition, these properties cannot be achieved at the same time. Bitcoin, for example, favors availability over consistency. In case of a network split, both networks can continue to live and contain potentially conflicting transactions (e.g., a double spend). If the network recovers from the split, however, only a single history will be accepted. Albatross favors consistency over availability. In case of a network split, either a single one of the network partitions can continue to operate or none (depending on the size of the partitions). However, there will never be an eventually incorrect view on the most recent state. If the network recovers from the split, the protocol will continue to operate normally again. Next steps Now that the technical description of Albatross is published and the protocol was presented by Reto Trinkler in the context of Katallassos at the EthCC’19 in Paris, these are the next steps to follow: We started to build a simulator for the Albatross protocol to evaluate its performance in large scale networks. Currently, this simulator only covers the base protocol without considering optimizations and Byzantine participants. We plan to extend this simulator and gain more insights into real-world operations of Albatross. In the meantime, we are also looking into potential optimizations for Albatross. These optimizations include the usage of Handel, which is a fast multi-signature aggregation protocol. Among other improvements, we are also considering the applicability of Verifiable Delay Functions to reduce communication in case of non-responding block producers. Finally, when these necessary prerequisites demonstrate the desired results, we will further assess the feasibility of integrating Albatross in Nimiq. This step would also include details such as block rewards, HTLCs, vesting contracts, and staking pools. We will then build a testnet running Albatross. Albatross could mean an immense increase of Nimiq’s performance while drastically cutting its energy consumption. While a successful implementation would bring fundamental improvements to Nimiq’s core, all of its implications have to be evaluated and considered thoroughly. Team Nimiq would make it its priority to allow for a smooth shift to a potential non-PoW future of Nimiq that we believe everybody would ultimately benefit from.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq is happy to announce support for blockchain domain names powered by Unstoppable Domains. With this new partnership, Nimiq wallet users can send and receive crypto to user-friendly domain names such as ‘yourname.wallet’. Our goal with this step is bringing us closer to widespread adoption by lowering entry barriers to the crypto space and making it more accessible for all humans alike. Watch how easy sending and receiving digital currencies is with a .wallet domain. Unstoppable Domains Unstoppable Domains focuses on building NFT Domains. NFT Domains are web extensions (just like ‘.com’) launched as smart contracts on public blockchains. They are built on the idea of a decentralized internet, allowing users to be the sole owner of their domain with tags like .crypto, .wallet, and .nft. Because your NFT Domain is an asset in the blockchain, it can be stored in your crypto wallet. This self-custodial aspect of NFT Domains gives them advantages over your common .com domains, for example: They work as usernames to replace all your wallets addresses for sending and receiving crypto They can host Decentralized Websites They can be used as a login for Dapps They can not be seized by third parties There are no renewal fees, ever. What does it mean for Nimiq users? At Nimiq we believe in making instant digital payments simple and accessible for users of all levels. It is for this reason that we are proud to be collaborating with Unstoppable Domains as a founding member of The .Wallet Alliance - an alliance of 24+ wallets - to standardize wallet usernames starting with Unstoppable Domain’s .wallet nft domains.  Today, we are excited to launch a giveaway to boost the adoption of Unstoppable Domains in our community. The Nimiq wallet offers support for native resolution of Unstoppable Domains as part of our commitment to making crypto transactions easier for everyone.  Giveaway First round of winners: 24 coupons of $40 credit in unstoppable domains. Like and ReTweet the Giveaway announcement. Tweet an image of your Nimiq Avatar adding the text “Join @unstoppableweb and @Nimiq #giveaway” and invite 3 friends. The Giveaway will run from Dec 28nd to Jan 8th. Only real accounts will be considered. All winners who activate their domain credit will have the chance to participate to win prizes of $500 in NIM. How do you use Unstoppable Domains and Nimiq? To get started you need to first secure your unstoppable domain here! Once you have your favorite domain secured, you can configure your address in the Unstoppable Domains Dashboard. Over 275 cryptocurrencies are supported, including Nimiq. Once you have your address configured in your domain, you can use it directly in the Nimiq Wallet where you would use your Nimiq Address. You can see it working in this video  A Step Forward in Crypto Mass Adoption By creating a new standard for simple usernames that works across all wallets globally we’re taking one step further to making peer-to-peer wallet transactions simpler, safer and a new global standard. We’re excited to work with this alliance to make crypto transactions an everyday reality for millions, then billions of people.

            <description><![CDATA[Summary of the Community Funding Board March meeting]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the first Nimiq Community Funding Board update since our community elections! This month's discussions are focused on two projects submitted by our community so let's get started. MetaNIM - NIMIQ payments browser extension Our first proposal to discuss was MetaNIM, a browser extension that uses an API from a non-custodial third party exchange to create a swap from NIM to other coins accepted by merchants in stores. This way you can pay in with NIM everywhere, the extension will take care of the automatic conversion. Several points were discussed. From Team Nimiq’s perspective, there is strong interest in not needing browser extensions, that is why there are none currently in the Nimiq ecosystem. This is because they introduce a new attack vector — we have seen several cases of browser plugin providers introducing malware recently. Also, you can't use them on mobile phones. However, at this time, a browser integration could be useful so we are open to consider it. We believe the project is a step in the right direction for Nimiq and that given time and support, it can become a great addition to the ecosystem. Additionally, the amount of funds being requested is also very reasonable. The board has decided to accept this proposal while at the same time asking for the project to be divided into milestones, which upon being met will unlock further funding. This is done with the intention of spending the funds optimally and in accordance to real progress being made. NimGraf - Street art for NIM mass adoption This project proposes a form of a geocaching game using physical airdrops and street art to spread Nimiq in France and worldwide, allowing people to know Nimiq, its uses, and simplicity.  The project struck us as engaging and interactive, and most of all, a good follow up to the recent visibility experienced by Nimiq. But we do have some concerns. The proposed budget of 10’000’000 NIM seems disproportional, we believe that server costs can be drastically reduced without reducing the potential of the project. Another concern of the board has to do with the target audience, which can be improved upon. Additionally, targeting public areas for street art could be breaking the law, which is something Nimiq cannot support. We have decided to request modifications for this proposal. We can provide mentorship for the program and help create a more suitable proposal, which will have to include changes in budget, scope and applicability. Most valuable NIMION The moment you were all waiting for, the most Valuable Nimion Award! For this month we have 2 winners!   Vasconselos Vasconcelos has been donating NIM in recent live streams of crypto influencers on YouTube and this has boosted the visibility of Nimiq. We want to reward him with 10’000 NIM. We are very excited about the recent NIMcubator efforts which have helped community members to create more proposals. We cannot wait for the next meeting to discuss all the new proposals that you will deliver this month. Until the next one, Nimiq Community Funding Board]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Rethinking the Nimiq brand]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We have spent the last few weeks rethinking the Nimiq brand. This process brought our mission, vision, brand persona and core values to a point where we were able to develop a visual language. We’re proud to finally show you this visual language, and, along with that, we also want to share the process of how we got there. The Process First of all, we weren’t starting from scratch. Nearly two years of legacy can’t and shouldn’t be neglected when embarking on a significant brand update. We looked closely at everything that was out there, sat down with the team, and conducted interviews with the community. We asked the hard questions to get an honest understanding of what the brand Nimiq is, rather than just creating an artificial image of what we imagine it to be. Drawing on those insights, we created a brand persona with character traits and a certain behavior, a persona not rooted in theory but in reality. In this way we can realistically embrace those characteristics that we want Nimiq to be associated with, and work on others that we don’t. Simplicity One of the most important values Nimiq strives for is simplicity. In the belief that stripping away everything that’s not necessary will lead to less cognitive load and eventually to a better experience. We took this ideal and built our efforts around it. The Logo When we started thinking about a new logo, it was clear from the beginning that we didn’t want to do a U-turn, but instead identify what we want to keep and what needs to go. Changing the logo was probably the biggest request from the community in terms of rebranding, so we actively included them in this process. We asked for input and got a lot of it — from rough directions to concrete and professional logo suggestions. Interestingly, in most of those suggestions, the hexagon played a central part. We, too, felt that the hexagon, standing on its stable side, was deeply connected with the Nimiq brand. Not only was it part of the logo, it was also used as a key visual for loaders, backgrounds or the world map in the miner, and even found its way into most community projects. We decided to keep it. On the other hand, it was clear that we should get rid of the dollar sign — based on constant feedback from the community, and some very practical problems like the use as a currency symbol. The most obvious approach was to replace it with some form of an N, to build a stronger connection to the Nimiqwordmark and make it more recognizable. Following those two prerequisites, and with our overall goal of simplicity in mind, we scribbled a lot and tried out a multitude of simple N-shaped logos, narrowed them down, decided on directions, iterated on them over and over again, until we ended up with a handful of logo options. They were all kind of okay and the majority of the team could live with them. The next step would have been to make a decision for one of those. But the fact that we had to make such a rational decision about something that we will put on everything Nimiq does made us wonder: How can we fascinate the community and everyone else if even we aren’t excited about it? So we took a step back. A wild idea appears One reason why none of the logos felt completely right, was that the distinct geometry of the hexagon and the unique form of the N-shaped symbol inside didn’t really match with our aim for simplicity — two shapes, one inside the other, just felt too complex. In fact, each symbol worked a lot better without the hexagon, but leaving the hexagon out wasn’t an option as that would mean losing a big part of Nimiq’s identity. The other reason was that there already are a lot of hexagonal logos with some kind of letter or symbol out there in the crypto space. So we thought, why don’t we just follow up on our aspiration for simplicity in the most radical way. Why don’t we just strip away everything besides the hexagon, customize this universal shape just a little bit to make it match with Nimiq’s brand values and go with it? Well, we did just that, and finally got this excitement among the team that had been missing. A plain hexagon as a logo — is that really all? One might argue that a hexagon on its own is too generic to be remembered and to stand out. We spent a lot of time thinking and arguing about whether this truly was a feasible option. In the end, we were convinced: It’s the only true representation of Nimiq and more unique than any other option on the table. Here’s why: The logo fully delivers on being simple. It’s an iconic shape that works all around the world in the same way (unlike the Latin “n”). The focus on the shape itself enhances the valuable resemblance of a coin, the sun or a piece of gold. In contrast to the vast array of clever and overly detailed crypto-logos, Nimiq really stands out — in the context of a logo wall, Coin Market Cap listings etc. We have the aspiration for Nimiq to be more than another crypto. Consequently, we need a logo that represents this ambition. Last but definitely not least: The plain hexagon is like a clean slate, ready for the community to fill. Anybody can take the logo and add something to it, making it their own while clearly contributing to the Nimiq ecosystem. Here again, the logo mirrors Nimiq’s brand values and a focus on the developer experience in a direct and functional way. Typography With the signet settled, we still needed to take care of the typography, for the logo and the overall corporate design. Here, we faced some additional challenges. First, it needed to be very simple and basic, especially after we decided to go for this radical simplicity in the logo, but at the same time we didn’t want to fall back to fonts like Roboto or Open Sans, because we felt we could never make one of those our own, due to the throngs of companies and projects already using them. Still, Nimiq being an Open Source platform, we needed to be sure to use a font that’s accessible for developers — meaning open source and ideally on Google Fonts. We found a font that ticks all of those boxes: Muli. It’s a very plain and simple sans-serif but has subtle, expressive accents that make it stand out. Furthermore, Muli is on Google Fonts and its source code is publicly accessible on Github. Wrap up Besides coming up with a new logo, we created a visual language around it, that we want to present in a dedicated style guide. We focus only on the logo in this article because it’s the most tangible representation of it. The new branding will be rolled out in the coming months and we’re very excited to see it in action. Here’s the link to the style guide: nimiq.com/styleguide (not accessible on most mobile devices for now). In case you’re on mobile, here’s a PDF fallback: nimiq.com/styleguide/styleguide.pdf]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[With this blog post we would like to update the community about the current developments and next steps towards the launch of Nimiq OASIS and give you a short overview of the first weeks since the launch of our public beta. Where we are now? On February 18, 2021, after many weeks of testing and optimizing, Team Nimiq presented the first public beta version of Nimiq OASIS to the world, which has been used live successfully since then. Users can buy NIM and BTC for up to $1'000 per month without having to rely on a custodial third-party intermediary holding the exchanged funds. The system has been thoroughly tested and in total ~85% of all Atomic Swaps were successful. Most incomplete swaps occurred due to incoming bank wires not being near instant, so they didn't make it on time before the crypto HTLC portion of the Atomic Swap timed out. Of the 15% failed swaps, 54% failed due to incoming transactions not being instant, 33% had the reference text missing or not correct (either people forgot or did a mistake copying the contract ID over to the reference field of their transaction in their online banking UI), 13% were above monthly limit, and for 3% the funding transaction was sent twice and thus refunded. By design all funds of expired and failed swaps have automatically been refunded. The system itself has also been further improved, for example the liquidity provider Fastspot now runs a so-called 'watchtower service' monitoring the blockchain and ensuring swaps succeed even if the user loses internet connectivity or closes the browser window. Overall, we're very excited that within this early time of releasing the beta, OASIS has already processed 1'650 successful swaps with over $260'000 in volume during Q1 2021 and more than $375'000 until today! What's to come? Now that we have been able to gain further experience with OASIS over several weeks and have been able to make important improvements in almost all areas, it is time for OASIS to grow out of its earliest stage and finally lose its 'beta' label. In the next step towards enabling the most decentralized and safest fiat on-ramp, we will launch the sell functionality of crypto against fiat and remove the initial $500 per-swap limit. Users will then be able to swap fiat for cryptocurrency and back again up to the established 30-day rolling window limit of $1'000. At the same time, we will publish the OASIS API including documentation and sandbox environment, so that other services can now also use OASIS and Fastspot as announced. The first exciting new partnerships are already emerging, which we will keep you informed about. From this point on, the increase of limits beyond the registration-free $1'000 and the expansion of the OASIS technology to other fiat currencies will be our top priority. Our partner TEN31 Bank is already working on a KYC (Know Your Customer) solution that will enable higher swap limits in the future and Team Nimiq will support the bank in all aspects of this next step. As it is not yet determined when this KYC solution will go live, we have taken this as an opportunity to add a new milestone to our roadmap for 2021: Nimiq OASIS Pro, which will enable European users to perform non-custodial swaps between crypto and fiat with larger amounts after completing a KYC procedure with TEN31 Bank. OASIS 1% Fee: Details on the locking procedure Since the launch of the Nimiq OASIS Public Beta on 18th February until Thursday 1st April, Nimiq OASIS has collected a total of US$ 2'690.00 (2.263,27 €) in fees from the swaps that have been performed during the first quarter. As previously announced, these collected fees will be used to buy NIM off the market for at least the first 24 months, which then are held by the Nimiq Foundation to increase scarcity and for the future benefit of the project. As a result of this plan, the first 225'242 NIM have been purchased on 1st April and are now stored on the preliminary holding address NQ23 6CYY 7AJG AM08 Y5G5 MHGX 6U4U 270A 7SH0 that belongs to the Nimiq Foundation. Please note that the address that holds those locked funds will be changed to a multisig address at some point in the future. The next NIM from the 1% fees will be purchased and locked after the second quarter ended on July 1, 2021. The locked-NIM holding address will always be publicly visible in the Nimiq blockchain explorers and we'll keep the community posted on all future updates with regard to this matter. OASIS Beta Launch: Press Coverage and Twitter Initiative With the release of Nimiq OASIS Beta, the Nimiq Communications team worked on broader news coverage regarding the kick-off and features of Nimiq OASIS and Nimiq in general. With this initiative we targeted hundreds of thousands of crypto enthusiasts in the blockchain space with the aim to try out OASIS and learn about Nimiq. You can find all news articles and the latest influencer and community videos at http://nimpress.news, a dedicated press clipping and news overview website created by the Nimiq Community. To promote the Nimiq OASIS Beta Launch on social media, we ran a special Twitter campaign to encourage users to spread the word about the beta launch. As the result of this promotion campaign, ten users who wrote about their first OASIS experience on Twitter using the hashtag #NimiqOASIS can now look forward to the refund of their swap! Today we are happy to announce the winners of this initiative: @ArMEnaK17, @NimiqManiac, @KlkQimin, @sam_atilola, @ionlarregui, @CryptoCappex, @Trymops @hssn13, @QR4World and @MaXi_N_Z. Congratulations to all of you and thank you once again for helping with the promotion of Nimiq OASIS. We are already looking forward to the next steps and especially the full roundtrip release of Nimiq OASIS in the near future. Last but not least, we would like to express our special thanks to our large, worldwide community, which has always been supporting us so energetically not only during the testing phase but also iduring the roll-out of the OASIS beta. We love you! 🧡 Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[An update on the current state of Nimiq 2.0]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The path we've already walked In early 2019, we started research on our high performance Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm called Albatross. We built a simulator to test the feasibility of the approach and published a paper detailing the concept. To bring Albatross to the browser, we researched and developed zero knowledge proofs that will drive our nano nodes and make it possible to sync with the blockchain in seconds even on mobile devices. In mid 2019 the team started work on a Rust implementation of Nimiq 2.0, working on multiple aspects of the new blockchain in parallel. Since Nimiq 2.0 is a novel, cutting-edge technology, implementing it always involves research and continuously revising our approach: Throughout 2020 we implemented some parts of the blockchain, tested them in combination with other parts and discovered that some things don't perform to our expectations so we moved forward to look for superior solutions. For example, we replaced pBFT with Tendermint, our network stack with libp2p and had to rework and extend Handel multiple times. But with each iteration, Nimiq 2.0 got better. The current state The core team has now arrived at and is working on putting the key building blocks together. As of now we are testing and debugging the node implementation with all components necessary to run the Testnet. In a setup like this, issues often become apparent only after the previous issue has been solved, which unfortunately makes it hard to parallelize the coding work beyond a practical point. The issues in the code are oftentimes small, but difficult to reproduce and even more difficult to find. Other parts of the core team are currently improving various aspects of the blockchain: The Nano Sync is making good progress, staking-related transactions are being improved and work is being done on the network layer. At the same time our designers have been busy creating shiny new user interfaces for the staking feature of Nimiq 2.0. There will be further fine-tuning and iterations on the designs and they look very promising already. What's next? Our current top priority in regards to Nimiq 2.0 is to get the public "Aurora" Testnet running. The Aurora Testnet is meant to let the broader community interact, test and push the network to its limits. However, at first it will require some technical knowledge to run it on your own machine. Bugs and changes are still to be expected in the early stages of the Aurora Testnet - after all, the Testnet exists to experiment and uncover issues! The first version of the Aurora Testnet will include nodes that process the full chain (history nodes) but will not yet include light-weight nodes that can run in the browser (nano nodes). That means a next big step after releasing the Testnet is to make the network browser-compatible. For that we will have to fully incorporate the Nano Sync, adjust the code such that it can be compiled to web assembly and enable nodes to efficiently query staking information. To a limited extent, the front-end team will already start implementing interfaces based on early versions of the Aurora Testnet. But the apps can only actually run on the Testnet after it has been made browser-compatible. Once the Nimiq Wallet, Keyguard and Hub have been adjusted to run on the Aurora Testnet, they will be provided as "Beta" in the Testnet setup. Community developers can also start testing their apps and services based on the Testnet. As soon as the blockchain code is reasonably stable and finished, it will receive extensive reviews by our security experts alongside a public bug-bounty program which will furthermore motivate external reviewers to harden the software and protocol of Nimiq 2.0. We will also implement and vigorously test the hardfork mechanism that is needed for the Nimiq 2.0 upgrade. Some of the outlined steps will happen in parallel, while others depend on each other, but it won’t be a one-way street: For example, issues might become apparent while integrating Nimiq 2.0 into the Wallet, which then might force us to go a step back and adjust the blockchain code again. Why does this take so long? Nimiq is implementing an entirely novel, very fast consensus algorithm. On top of that Nimiq strives to make the benefits of blockchain technology usable by everyone by enabling decentralized payments directly in your browser. No other project has achieved what we are going for and so there is no perfect map for the challenges that lie ahead. We introduced the “lab” icons on the roadmap to reflect that time estimates for the release of Nimiq 2.0 are exactly that, estimates. We understand that those estimates still create expectations and are always encouraged by seeing our community so excited. While we have already come a long way and are continuously making good progress, we realize that we cannot keep the target of launching the Nimiq 2.0 Mainnet in Q1 2021 and have to update our guidance on that to the following quarters. In an attempt to better meet expectations, instead of relying on specific time frames, we will regularly inform the community about the progress being made, current challenges and next steps. Nimiq is known for pursuing cutting edge tech and combining it with new levels of usability while building on organic growth. We aim to continue to live up to these ideals for Nimiq 2.0: We will not take shortcuts in terms of security or stability and deliver the fastest, most usable payment protocol while staying true to the pillars of crypto (open, borderless, censorship resistant, neutral and public). Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq introduced Blockchain technology native to the World Wide Web (Copy from Medium Original)]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Introduction On June 6th we published the Nimiq Beta Testnet to get early community feedback and gather real-world data. Some people were missing the nerdy talk. So here it is: Nimiq is a frictionless peer-to-peer payment protocol for the World Wide Web. It is a third-generation Blockchain protocol combining elements of Bitcoin and Ethereum, streamlined for the web platform. And without a doubt, it is open source and fully decentralized. Browsers are first-class citizens in the Nimiq distributed network. They are able to establish consensus with the network, and enable true peer-to-peer payments from within, all without a trusted third party. In comparison to conventional cryptocurrencies, this browser-first approach lowers barriers of entry by orders of magnitudes for developers, customers and merchants. Overview The main challenge of a web-based Blockchain is to translate the core Blockchain components to the web platform: Network for establishing P2P connections. Storage for persistent keys and Blockchain data. Crypto for hashing, signing and verifying. In addition, the protocol must be streamlined for the constraints of the web: Compression of Blockchain data to sync within seconds instead of hours. Instant and scalable transactions so over-the-counter payments are practical. Simplicity means we do only one thing and we do it better than anyone else: payments. Blockchain Parameters streamlined for our browser-first approach. Cross-Chain Compatibility with other Blockchains such as Ethereum for advanced smart contract features. Translating the Blockchain Primitives to the Web Platform Network Nimiq’s peer-to-peer network uses WebRTC and WebSocket connections. There are two types of nodes in the Nimiq network: Backbone Nodes and Browser Nodes. Both types use the same isomorphic JavaScript code base. Backbone Nodes are based on NodeJS and run on servers. They communicate with each other via WebSockets, and they act as entry point and signaling server for Browser Nodes to establish browser-to-browser WebRTC connections. Browser Nodes are built upon browser engines and therefore they are completely installation-free. To connect to the network, they establish a WebSocket connection to at least one Backbone Node. Once they have established their first connection, they start to establish browser-to-browser connections using the Backbone Node as signaling server. Browser Nodes can also act as signaling server for further browser-to-browser connections. In the long run, Browser Nodes will mainly be light-clients, and they won’t necessarily participate as miners. Their main purpose is to establish consensus quickly to prove their accounts’ balances and send transactions into the network. Serious Miners might prefer to run mainly Backbone Nodes for performance and convenience reasons, even though we want to keep the benefit of running a backbone node low in order to balance incentives in the direction of our browser-first approach. Moreover, even Browsers running light-clients will contribute resources to the network: They share the (compressed) Blockchain data with other browsers to reduce the network load on the backbone nodes. There are some drawbacks of this approach: Depending on the user’s NAT configuration, direct peer-to-peer connections may not be able to be established. They would need a TURN server to connect to other browsers. In this case, it makes more sense to connect only to Backbone Nodes via WebSockets, because the network load on TURN servers would be unnecessary high. Powerful browser APIs are restricted to secure origins. So for browsers to connect, Backbone Nodes need to provide an encrypted connection via SSL. This requires a domain and an SSL certificate. For easy and cheap access to domains, we will provide dynamic DNS and Letsencrypt packaged in an installer. Depending on the user’s firewall configuration, connections to non-standard ports may not be able to be established. In this case, at least some nodes need to run on the standard 443 port. To avoid running the node as root, it is a good idea to use NGINX as reverse proxy. Storage Browser Nodes use the IndexedDB API to store Blockchain data and keys on the user’s hard drive. Since the browser can’t store gigabytes of data, we compress the Blockchain with the Mini-Blockchain scheme (see Compression). In the beta testnet, the private key is stored unencrypted and gets deleted if the user clears his browser history. In the mainnet we will have much higher security standards: With Chrome’s Storage Persistence API the data survives even if you clear your browser data. The private key will always be stored encrypted. Furthermore, we will provide users with a simple app to backup their key in a printed paper wallet. We are also planning on supporting cold-wallets via Web USB or Web Bluetooth. Crypto Since performance is security relevant, we need performant crypto primitives. A JavaScript implementation would not be sufficient. Betanet Crypto The crypto in the preliminary beta testnet is based on the WebCrypto APIs to reach near native performance. The WebCrypto API is not very rich and leads to too many sub-optimal design decisions. Therefore we won’t use it for the mainnet. Proof-of-Work Algorithm: We use SHA-256, because it is the only hash function supported by WebCrypto, and is sufficient for our first public testnet. Digital Signing Algorithm: We use the NIST curve P-256, because it is the only curve supported by WebCrypto. Mainnet Crypto (preliminary) The cryptographic primitives in the mainnet will be based on WebAssembly for near native performance and full flexibility in our choice of crypto algorithms. Proof-of-Work Algorithm: We will use a more sophisticated PoW in the mainnet because SHA-256 will lead to centralized mining. The mainnet PoW should be memory-hard & low energy for truly decentralized mining with regular hardware. There is no final decision on any specific algorithm yet. We are investigating multiple candidates such as Argon2 (too slow though) or ETHash, and we are very open to suggestions by the community. Proof-of-Stake Algorithm: We would strongly prefer to switch to a Proof-of-Stake Algorithm in the long run to get to a more energy-efficient Blockchain system. We are following the research of other projects such as Ethereum, and we are investigating multiple candidates such as Ouroboros. Just as well, we are very open to suggestions by the community. Digital Signing Algorithm: We use Ed25519 because it uses “nothing up my sleeves parameters” chosen for performance and it is becoming an industry standard. More Fundamental Browser APIs ES6 Classes for a clear and simple object oriented design. Promises and the beloved async/await to escape from callback hell. ArrayBuffer and views to serialize Blockchain data to byte level for crypto operations, network and storage. Streamlining the protocol for the constraints of the Web Platform Compression It is nonsensical to have web users download gigabytes of Blockchain data to establish consensus. Especially in the case of a weak network connection, which would make this nearly impossible. So we need to compress the data such that light-clients can synchronize within seconds. That’s where the Mini-Blockchain Scheme comes into play: It introduces an Accounts Tree (a Merkle Patricia Tree) which has multiple advantages in comparison to the design of Bitcoin: It simplifies transactions. The end user doesn’t need to deal with the concept of unspent outputs. Only an account and a balance is contained. The user can download only the headers of the Blockchain plus simple cryptographic proofs for account balances, which breaks down to downloading only a couple of hundred kilobytes instead of gigabytes without losing trust or security. Old blocks can be discarded because the complete state is stored in the Accounts Tree. Nano clients can use signed checkpoints to keep the headers chain constant size. Additionally, the full Blockchain up to each checkpoint will be provided for download to make public verification of these checkpoints easy. We will proceed to implement the Mini Blockchain Scheme as per development plan. It is easy to listen for balance changes. Instant transactions Based on “The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments” Nimiq implements Hashed Timelock Contracts to enable payment channels and within those scalable instant off-chain transactions. This solves the scalability issues beyond micro-payments. Moreover, they enable atomic swaps for cross-chain interoperability. There are also approaches to enable onion routing on top the Lightning Network to provide anonymity in a way similar to the Tor Browser. Simplicity: No scripting language. Simplicity is the best heuristic to building a secure system. So the only feature of Nimiq is fast and secure payments from UserA to UserB. Nimiq intentionally doesn’t have a scripting language, because Ethereum already solves the smart contract problem better then we could ever do. We do not try to compete in this field. We want to be compatible with Ethereum such that Nimiq users can easily use Ethereum’s smart contract features if they want to. There is one exception to the “no smart contracts” approach: For the Lightning Network there will be a hashed timelock contract hardcoded into the protocol. Blockchain Parameters (preliminary) Block time: 1 minute (inspired by the results of On the Security and Performance of Proof of Work Blockchains) Block reward: starts with 5 Nimiq (NIM); halves every ~2'100'000 blocks. This approach models Bitcoin’s approach, while taking into account that Nimiq’s block time is 10 times faster. (In the betanet the reward is just constant) Max Block size: 1 MB Difficulty adjustment: Every 10 blocks Total supply: 21 Mio Coins divisible by 10⁸ (just like Bitcoin) Cross-Chain Compatibility Hash Timelock Contracts not just allow off-chain transactions and scalability. We will use them for cross-chain transactions to become compatible with the great work of projects like Ethereum and Bitcoin. This allows Nimiq users to use the advanced smart contract features of Ethereum and it allows users of other cryptocurrencies to easily exchange into Nimiq without an intermediary. Conclusion Nimiq introduced Blockchain technology native to the World Wide Web. In comparison to conventional cryptocurrencies, this approach lowers barriers of entry by orders of magnitudes and will foster mass-adoption of cryptocurrencies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq Joins #TeamSeas Effort To Clean Up Our Oceans In November 2019, we joined the cause of #TeamTrees and helped planting 20 million trees. Now once again, Nimiq is supporting YouTuber MrBeast in his efforts to make the world a better place. This time, Team Nimiq is joining the initiative to remove 30 million pounds of garbage from the oceans by January 2022. We can only achieve this with your help. Nimiq #TeamSeas Campaign Participate by donating to #TeamSeas in the Nimiq Shop from now until December 29th. Every $1 donated will be matched by the Nimiq Foundation with an extra $1 donation. Up to $10,000 in donations. Use the Nimiq cards service to give NIM to your loved ones and suggest them to donate to #TeamSeas. Why This Matters The oceans and their biodiversity are essential for the planet and all living beings. They produce more than half the air we breathe and regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It doesn't take blockchain developers to understand why this is critical to our survival. Sadly, poor regulations, unplanned development and corporate greed have gotten in the way. Today, our oceans, rivers and beaches are full of plastic waste. It’s estimated that there are 200M tons of plastic already circulating in marine environments, with an estimated 11M tons entering the ocean every year.1 Pollution from everyday plastic items will last for generations. Unless we do something about it! While it takes ages for plastic to break down, when it does due to sunlight and heat, it releases powerful greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere.2 There is a strong link between plastic and climate change and you can learn more about it here. What is Nimiq? Nimiq is a cryptocurrency for humans. We pride ourselves on having the easiest and fastest onboarding into crypto. But we’re also a green blockchain, working hard to reduce the energy being used and supporting good causes through the ImpactX foundation. If you want to support #TeamSeas through Nimiq, you can buy NIM here. Watch this video to get started! Why We Are Joining We can no longer look away. Efforts are being taken at a public and private scale never seen before. The impact of plastic and microplastic trash in the ocean - they already cover the seabed - will affect generations to come and, even worse, we have no clear fix at hand. Team Nimiq chooses to be a part of the solution and encourages all individuals and corporations to take action and be inspired by one another to create a better world. Nimiq was founded with the idea that a blockchain project can make a positive impact by making charity a priority through supporting efforts focused on high social and environmental impact. It’s what we call ‘responsible blockchain development’. Nimiq’s passion for environmental preservation comes from its strong presence in Costa Rica, a place that literally translates to ‘Rich Coast’ and is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. In these remote locations, local community programs try to promote beach clean-up events and teach their community about the importance of marine wildlife and how to coexist in a balanced way. Knowing about the power of change that joint communities can have, Team Nimiq has been inspired by these local efforts and by the global #TeamSeas campaign.  Use Your NIM To Clean Them Up! Team Nimiq calls on all Nimiq community members to support this great cause by heading over to the Nimiq shop. For every $1 donated using the Web Shop, Team Nimiq will donate another $1 to the #TeamSeas Challenge to remove two pounds of garbage from the sea. We will keep the promotion open until December 29th, allowing any potential holiday gifts to be used to donate 😉. We will then count the donations in the Web Shop and proceed to donate twice the amount to TeamSeas. The results will be shared publicly on TeamSeas’s website and announced on Nimiq’s Twitter account. Let’s help save the oceans two pounds at a time. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq https://teamseas.org/ https://www.wwf.org.au/]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[When opportunity turns into groundbreaking innovation]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Team Nimiq is thrilled to announce that we are developing a new and potentially disruptive Crypto-to-Fiat bridge in collaboration with the German WEG Bank AG and Swiss-Maltese non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange Agora.Trade. Today we would like to introduce a high-level description of what this solution means, how this next big step in Nimiq’s journey came about and what’s been happening behind the scenes. This innovative approach focuses on making the Euro (USD, etc) directly behave as if it was a token on the blockchain, by providing a smart and unique way of connecting the traditional banking network with crypto exchanges. It could disrupt existing stablecoins, over-the-counter (OTC) and crypto payment processing markets by enabling an open, simple and fast way to exchange value between crypto and fiat systems. Challenging the crypto payment processors could have a profound impact on online merchants in the space and eliminate unnecessary middlemen. Connecting the dots In October 2018, Nimiq came in contact with Matthias von Hauff, the progressively thinking Founder and CEO of the WEG Bank AG. The fruitful initial conversations between Nimiq co-founder Elion Chin and Matthias von Hauff called for a more extensive get-together in person. The opportunity to brainstorm and bring Nimiq together with a traditional bank proprietor that is uniquely open to crypto made sense in every way. While the meeting was swiftly scheduled for November 2018 during Nimiq’s hackathon in Costa Rica, the growing relationship with Agora Trade triggered the idea to also invite its founding partners Reto Trinkler and Andrea Castiglione to expand the brainstorming into a roundtable triangle of boundless creative potential: Payment protocol: Nimiq, the browser-first blockchain that leads with ease-of-use, represented by Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, Pascal Berrang, Marvin Wissfeld, Elion Chin and counsel Mauricio Lara. Financial institution: German WEG Bank AG and its ‘can do’ crypto-revolution-friendly owner Matthias von Hauff. Exchange: Non-custodial, browser-based exchange Agora Trade and its visionary founders Reto Trinkler and Andrea Castiglione. Making magic happen In just three days the group went from sharing their respective views regarding technological solutions and practical needs, to Philipp, Pascal and Marvin drafting a groundbreaking scheme blueprint for Crypto ⟷ Euro (USD, etc) transactions: an approach that establishes the Euro itself as the programmable counterparty to a non-custodial cross-chain transaction. In simple terms, it means that in a transaction to buy or sell Crypto, the counterparty could now be a Euro account holder, Without a single, centralized intermediary ever controlling the two assets that are being exchanged, and Without the owner of each asset giving up custody until the conditions for the settlement are verifiably fulfilled. One of the beauties of the solution is, that it works without issuing or acting through a stablecoin, by enabling the Euro directly to behave as if it was a token on a blockchain. Introducing Nimiq OASIS Nimiq has set out to develop Nimiq OASIS (Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme), the middle layer that powers Fiat / Crypto trades as described above. Following additional engineering meetings with Fiducia GAD IT AG, one of Germany’s largest financial institution API providers, Nimiq has recently finalized the specification of this layer. NIM ⟷ Euro trades will be triggered on the Agora Trade platform and supported by the WEG Bank AG. The general potential of Nimiq OASIS goes far, as following an introductory period, it will be non-exclusive and empower other banks, exchanges and blockchains to tie in and allow decentralization and adoption in ways that reflect the spirit of blockchain technology. Matthias von Hauff, Founder and CEO of WEG Bank AG: “For the past 12 months, we have been looking at various ways to expand our core banking activities into the blockchain community. With Nimiq, we have a team to develop not only a landmark payment interface which has the potential to revolutionize the way we deal with cryptocurrencies, but also an innovative and powerful partnership.” Reto Trinkler, Co-Founder of Agora Trade, Forbes ’30 Under 30’ list maker: “Overregulation and lack of innovation lead to the development of custodial exchanges and financial intermediaries such as stablecoins. By combining an easy­-to-­use payment token, a non­custodial exchange and an innovative fiat bank we go back to the heart of what blockchain is all about; Self­-sovereignty and removing unnecessary middlemen.” What is the disruptive potential? A Crypto-to-Fiat bridge powered by Nimiq OASIS could significantly change the landscape of the following markets: Over-the-counter market: This is built on matching and executing large scale crypto-to-fiat transactions. The vision is to enable the solution to scale through strategic partnerships and bring increasing amounts of liquidity. This could have deep ramifications for those drawn to more conventional OTC markets. Quite simply, these entities and individuals could sooner or later have a much quicker, easier and cheaper alternative to move value between the two ecosystems. Stablecoin market: The recent rise and popularity for alternative stablecoins to Tether has demonstrated the demand amongst crypto investors for a convenient way to hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Nimiq OASIS could provide these users with an alternative and could be set to eat into the market share by allowing the non-custodial transfer of value between crypto and fiat. Online crypto payment processing: In short, this market acts as a middleman to transfer funds between crypto markets and the traditional banking system. By tying directly into decentralized exchanges, this solution has the potential to eliminate the need for 3rd party custodial processors and has the potential to disrupt the business models of industry leaders. It can also make it easier and cheaper for platforms to accept crypto deposits and for merchants to adopt crypto payment methods. How NIM and the Nimiq Ecosystem can benefit While this significant contribution to the cryptocurrency universe is intended as open source, there are some direct benefits to the Nimiq project and community. Marketing: Nimiq brands and looks to license this technology — leveraging the power of this scheme to work as a form of native marketing. Fee percentage: WEG Bank AG recognizes Nimiq’s critical contribution to their venture and grants the project a percentage of the fees they might collect. Nimiq intends to use this potential source of income to further promote the project and its adoption. Zero fee trade: Agora Trade is committed to listing NIM as first coin for cross-chain trades with ETH and BTC. In recognition of Nimiq’s contribution, Agora Trade will not charge fees for any NIM related exchange services, which creates a strong and unique incentive to use and trade NIM. Nimiq, WEG Bank AG and Agora Trade have already started implementing these plans and are targeting going live with first non-custodial NIM|BTC|ETH to Euro trades by Q4 2019. A post with more technical details on Nimiq OASIS will follow. The Nimiq team would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to our amazing community that shares the passion in our hearts. We are more committed than ever to revolutionizing money.

            <description><![CDATA[What good is a decentralized monetary system if the entry and exit are centralized, custodial, and prone to censorship?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're reading this article, chances are high that you are a Nimiq supporter and know about OASIS, Fastspot, TEN31 Bank, and most likely you know the Nimiq Wallet as well. There are many entities and technical concepts involved that, together, enable what we consider a true innovation: Swap between crypto and conventional currency in a self-custodial and decentralized way. But what makes Nimiq special is not only the ability to produce technological innovation. It's the ease of use that turns complicated tech into real-world value for everyday humans. And we're just getting started. Super simple swaps Today, we are introducing a unique product made by Nimiq: a standalone service that aspires to be the easiest, fastest, safest, and most accessible way to buy and sell crypto. And on top of that, it'll be one of the cheapest as well. That's a lot of superlatives but we're absolutely convinced we have the tech and ability to deliver on each one. But before we get into them, let's first talk about the product. A signup-free web app that puts together Fastspot, TEN31 and Nimiq OASIS to enable the unique concept of a fiat smart contract as a single service: one that provides self-custodial atomic swaps between crypto and conventional currency. No additional wallet needs to be created to use the service: any existing wallet is supported. The service currently supports EUR, BTC, and NIM, with more currencies being added in the future. By connecting the basic touch points of users with fiat and crypto – the bank account and the crypto wallet – this service removes intermediaries, cuts out the middlemen and avoids the costs and centralization that come with them. In short, it will be a super simple way to swap fiat and crypto. That's why we call it SuperSimpleSwap. Creating a great user experience SuperSimpleSwap, or S3 for short, is itself the combination of multiple complex and interconnected parts into a super-simple user experience. People new to crypto will be able to use it with ease because of its simplicity, while more tech-savvy users will appreciate the high degree of decentralization — and both will enjoy the extra level of security.   From absolute beginner to owning crypto in 5 minutes Here is all it takes for you to hold your own BTC or NIM. Visit supersimpleswap.com and Set the amount of crypto you want to buy Enter the bank name you're going to be paying from Enter the wallet address for receiving crypto or create a new Nimiq wallet supporting NIM and BTC on the fly Click 'Start Swap' Send a SEPA Instant transaction to the indicated bank account And receive your crypto within minutes. Did you notice that no sign-up process was needed to do that? So, in conclusion, crypto can now be bought and sold directly from and to your bank account! No exchange in-between, no centralized service keeping your keys, no identification process up-front. The costs? A mere 1.5% of the swapped amount! How does it work? In short: The OASIS scheme, implemented by TEN31 Bank, enables Euro smart contracts. Euro smart contracts enable crypto to Euro atomic swaps.  The costs? A mere 1.5% of the swapped amount! A while back, Nimiq released this blog post about the same tech being used in the Nimiq wallet. If you want to get into the weeds, it describes the underlying process in great detail. SuperSimpleSwap and Nimiq Instead of applying the Nimiq-branding, we gave S3 a neutral look to appeal to all crypto users equally. We all know how sensitive Bitcoin maximalists can be when it comes to other crypto projects. In a similar vein, users also don't have to create a new wallet with S3, they can use the wallet they know and love. All wallets work with SuperSimpleSwap. Similar to other implementations of Nimiq OASIS, all swaps directly benefit Nimiq — regardless of the assets being swapped. The fee covers all costs created by the swap and retains a margin for potential referral partners. The rest is used to buy and lock NIM off the market. The more adoption, the more NIM will be locked and taken off the market, creating scarcity. More to come Right now, SuperSimpleSwap supports Euro but we are working on adding more fiat currencies in the future. In Europe, we can use the new SEPA Instant network to allow swaps to take place in minutes. Not all banks are connected in Europe yet, but the number is constantly growing. You can find more details here. At the same time, more banks worldwide are working on similar schemes to enable near-instant wire transfers between banks. We are closely monitoring the space and will reach out to new networks as they become available. We are already in conversation with the central bank in Costa Rica, which could give us access to Central America. Outlook Right now, swaps are limited to $1000 per month, roughly €800, without requiring any additional identification process, also known as KYC. It's a reasonable amount to get started, but of course we are working on making it possible to swap even more, while at the same time complying with existing anti-money laundering requirements. While we're excited to release SuperSimpleSwap today, we're far from done. Here, without any chronological order, are some concrete next steps we're planning to take to increase S3's functionality: Offer an embeddable and customizable widget for third parties Add a referral program for partners, influencers and anyone who wants to promote S3 Add more fiat and more cryptocurrencies Add a 'pro feature' that allows for higher limits after passing a KYC procedure That was a lot of information, but in the end there's no better way to explain what S3 is than to try it out for yourself. So head over to SuperSimpleSwap.com and make your first atomic crypto-fiat swap! Happy swapping! Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq (NIM) is now available on all SALAMANTEX-enabled payment devices and in e-commerce!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[With the recent update to the SALAMANTEX interface, NIM (Nimiq) is now accepted as payment currency at all connected merchants. This makes NIM part of an exclusive group of cryptocurrencies which can be used to pay for goods and services on payment terminals and in e-commerce. NIM (Nimiq) is the latest addition to the SALAMANTEX portfolio of digital assets with which consumers can pay at selected merchants for goods and services. The portfolio already includes Bitcoin, Ether, Dash, Litecoin, Stellar, and Ripple. Austrian Fintech SALAMANTEX offers software which enables business owners and e-commerce to accept digital and cryptocurrencies as means of payment and choose whether to receive the purchase price in conventional fiat currencies or directly in a cryptocurrency of their choice. "This integration is a huge step forward for Nimiq, as we're transitioning from vision to real-world crypto payments. We are realizing our mission to build the ideal payment cryptocurrency in an increasingly digital payment world”, says Nimiq ambassador Max Burger. “With the scheduled SALAMANTEX expansion into the Eurozone from its home base in Austria, we aim for NIM to become available as payment currency for an even wider customer base in the close future.” SALAMANTEX combines smart, trusted and secure software solutions into one crypto payment experience. The system seamlessly integrates into the existing payment infrastructure, allowing for a fast and smooth roll-out into the network of connected merchants - online and offline across the entire Eurozone. Through the cooperation with the Concardis Nets Group alone, more than 116.000 clients across the DACH region can be served. What is more, through the collaboration with Ingenico, a global leader in payment solutions with over 30 million installed payment devices, SALAMANTEX aims at making crypto payments accessible for a wide audience - a first step towards mass adoption. “We are excited to welcome Nimiq to our ecosystem, serving two key purposes at once. Building the infrastructure for blockchains like NIM and their community to utilize the full potential of the digital financial future is at the core of what we do at SALAMANTEX. At the same time, we enable retailers and acquirers to join that future, building the payment landscape of tomorrow. Accepting cryptocurrencies as means of payment for goods and services is where these two industries overlap, and SALAMANTEX proudly facilitates this connection”, states SALAMANTEX CEO René Pomassl. From today on, consumers are able to natively pay with NIM on all Salamantex-enabled POS terminals and in e-commerce stores. On the merchant side, this upgrade doesn’t require any effort as the new currency option is automatically integrated into the already installed software. This development shows the future orientation of the SALAMANTEX solution. Merchants commit to the installation once and then benefit from all future expansion of the software, truly allowing the future-proofing of their business as payment pioneers. For customers, paying with cryptocurrencies via SALAMANTEX is ‘just as simple as with a credit card’: the customer selects the desired cryptocurrency, such as NIM, on the payment device, the exchange rate is displayed and guaranteed for the duration of the payment process. As a last step, the customer scans the now displayed QR-code with any smartphone wallet and the device confirms the successful transaction and provides a receipt. The merchant receives the value of the goods at the time of the transaction and has no risk with regard to possible exchange rate fluctuations. He can choose whether to receive the purchase price in Euro or the corresponding amount in the cryptocurrency. The intuitive end-to-end solution can be integrated into existing payment systems, whether online in the webshop or at the point of sale, on a POS terminal, smartphone or computer. Both projects will present at this year’s Blockchance Conference, one of Europe’s leading blockchain events, taking place in Hamburg (Germany) on December 2-4, 2021. Together, SALAMANTEX and Nimiq will showcase the potential behind their partnership and demonstrate real-life cryptocurrency payments.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Call to charitable action for the crypto industry]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[When you are in the position to pursue the creation of a useful crypto currency (or token), it just appears profoundly relevant to consider tying into it a verifiable commitment to giving back. On a global scale we are dealing with growing ecological challenges (water pollution, deforestation, etc) and we live in an increasingly divided world (access to the monetary system, education, health care, etc). Social media provides us with more insights into disparities and increased awareness provides an opportunity for crypto projects to align their purpose and emotional connection with the generation that cares. Imagine the combined impact the industry could have if every crypto project was to adopt a similar pledge. In hindsight, at the current combined market cap of around $2 trillion that would translate to $40 billion the crypto industry could have allocated for good! Going forward it is an important “why” that any project can add to the list of reasons for pursuing success. Nimiq wants to set an example and encourage other crypto projects to join in their commitment. Getting started The best way to implement and communicate such a commitment—and the way Nimiq did it—is by including it from the very beginning of the project. That allows transparently informing all contributors and stakeholders of such coin or token “allocation by design”. Of course it is also possible for established crypto projects to retrofit for such a commitment, but it requires approaching their respective governing community or entity for majority consent.  Verifiably designating the 2% of coin supply—”Crypto for good” Nimiq at creation of its Genesis Block in April 2018 allocated 2% (420 million) of its total maximum coin supply (21 billion) to a special Nimiq wallet address. This wallet address is owned by the ImpactX Foundation, a registered 501c3 that was set up specifically for the purpose of “supporting projects of high social and ecological impact” (nimiq.com/about/#charity). If NIM were to reach 1/100th of the market cap of Bitcoin for example, the USD equivalent of these funds to use for good would almost reach half a billion USD! It is important to choose a setup that protects the intended charitable purpose and use of funds through the entity's statutes and its jurisdiction. Time release   While control of funds should at the very least be decentralized via multi-signature cold storage wallets and other security enhancing means, an additional factor to consider is to enforce a “gradual release” approach for the designated 2% of coin supply. This encourages taking a longer term view for the use of these funds in line with growth and reach of the project in time. In the case of Nimiq’s ImpactX Foundation, the 420 million NIM are bound in a vesting type smart contract which programmatically releases portions periodically over the course of 10 years. To be precise, 1/20th of the 420 million NIM vests every 6 months which is publicly verifiable in any Nimiq block explorer.  Governing the allocation to positive impact In its early stage, the founding visionary board decides on which social or ecological impact efforts portions of funds may be allocated to, if any. With maturing of the efforts and value to give away or “impact invest”, the idea is to switch to a governance model that will allow voting by the coin holding (or mining or staking) community. In the case of ImpactX, the idea is that voting happens with proof of NIM holdings, which will determine the allocation projects and amounts as they present themselves. The foundation board, which itself is elected on a periodic basis, is the one tasked with executing the decisions that follow from the community vote.  Transparency report As a final step and to close the loop of setting up such a “Pledge 2%” model, Nimiq expects to release an annual transparency report that details the use of funds of the ImpactX Foundation, with links to the projects and blockchain transactions that identify the donations made. This establishes trust and traceability in the process.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Protecting against the new threat of clipboard hijacking]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[On the 8th of February 2019, Lukas Stefanko announced that WeLiveSecurity.com had identified the first case of clipper malware on the Google Play store. It is no surprise that this newly discovered malware was designed to steal cryptocurrency. Nimiq is protected from clipboard hijacking by design, thanks to the Nimiq Identicons. Metamask clone exploits copy & paste The malware was found impersonating Metamask on the Google Store and was built to steal a users crypto in two ways: To get the users private keys and gain control of the victim’s wallet. By replacing a BTC or ETH wallet address copied to a clipboard with one being controlled by the hacker. Metamask browser extension, used by more than 1.3 million users The scary thing about stealing crypto through clipboard hijacking is that it exploits user behavior. With any cryptocurrency, receiver wallet addresses are a very long and difficult to memorize string of numbers and letters. To keep things straight forward, most crypto users are copy and pasting the receiver address when processing transactions. Clipboard hijacking: how does it work? Clipboard hijacking malware works by monitoring the clipboards of infected computers for cryptocurrency addresses. Essentially, if the malware detects a cryptocurrency address on the user’s clipboard, it will swap it out for an address owned by the thieves. In most cases, crypto clipboard hijackers are limited to a few hundred thousand addresses. However, in mid-2018 BleepingComputer discovered malware monitoring 2.3 million crypto wallet addresses. The truth is that most users do not know that they have been infected with clipboard hijacking malware until it’s too late. The malware simply runs in the background and there is no indication that it’s even there. How can Nimiq Identicons combat clipboard hijacking For those that don’t know, an identicon is “a visual representation of a hash value . . . that serves to identify a user of a computer system as a form of avatar while protecting the users’ privacy”. With Nimiq, virtually-unique identicons are assigned to every account address (Nimiqs terminology in place of “wallet address”) and aim to make each address identifiable at just a glance. Based on Robohash, the challenge Nimiq had to overcome when developing its identicons, was to ensure they are exceptionally recognizable whilst also offering a high level of variability to enable the generation of a different identicon for each Nimiq account address. Indeed, identicons are used to help visualize Ethereum addresses in popular wallets like MyEtherWallet. However, these types of identicons are more geared to tech-savvy audiences and typical internet users often don’t find them recognizable, distinguishable or memorable. Identicons of Ethereum addresses Now, that’s a big problem when you consider the intended function of identicons, as the creator of the concept put it: “IMHO, too much of the web what we read are textual or numeric information which are not easy to distinguish at a glance when they are jumbled up together. So I think adding visual identifiers will make the user experience much more enjoyable.” - Don Park, creator of the identicon concept Identicons of Nimiq addresses The key success factor here is that Nimiq Identicons are highly distinguishable and memorable so that users can identify different account addresses easily. So, when you are trying to confirm to your friends that they are indeed sending to the intended account address: Instead of repeating your Nimiq account address NQ57 KNAL 9PG2 ATVG EBDD 6SMG HUHD M959 SG1B you can say… It’s the orange unicorn with green eyes and antennas. This makes checking account addresses significantly easier, humans are simply better at describing visualizations, rather than a long string of letters and numbers. We also think this way of verifying account addresses is more fun too. If a Nimiq user is subject to a clipboard hijacking attack and the malware replaces the Nimiq address on the clipboard with an account address controlled by the attacker, then the user will paste this fraudulent address into the send field and the receiving addresses identicon will be shown instantly. If you are sending NIM to a friend and you see an identicon different from their usual one, then you instantly know that someone has launched a clipboard hijacking attack against you (or you made a typo or copy-paste error yourself). If you are sending to someone you don’t know, you can just ask them like “are you the orange guy, with the soccer ball, blue lobster claws, and the blue background?”. Want to check out some of Nimiq’s Identicons for yourself? Take a look here. There is also an ongoing effort to improve the usability in the check-at-a-glance user interaction, by adding a suggested name to each identicon. Many thanks and credit to community developer Terorie for contributing the naming scheme. Yes, it’s true that clipboard hijacking attacks can be protected against by double or triple checking recipient account addresses before sending. However, that does make things more complicated and time-consuming, also most people trust that their computer will paste what they copied. That’s why the instant recognizability and huge variation of Nimiq Identicons can help protect NIM users and foil clipboard hijacking attempts in both a simple and straight forward way. The huge variety of Nimiq Identicons Each Nimiq Identicon has five different elements, bottoms, faces, sides, tops body, and background color. Each element has a distinctive color. In total, identicons are made up of a combination of: 21 bottoms 21 faces 21 sides 21 tops 8 colors for parts 9 body colors 10 background colors That means there are 10 * 9 * 8 * 21⁴ = 140,026,320 different identicons that can be generated. This means that Nimiq is capable of generating more than 100 million highly differentiated and instantly recognizable identicons. Final word The fake MetaMask app in the Google Play store just goes to show how bad actors are evolving and changing their methods to steal crypto by trying to exploit common user behavior. We hope this example helps you to better understand the value of Nimiq Identicons and why it’s useful to have a method for users to easily recognize addresses. In extension of the ease-of-use of the Nimiq Identicons, we look forward to soon rolling out the new Nimiq Identicon naming scheme and sharing it with the community. If you don’t have a Nimiq Identicon yet and want to choose your own right now, you can do so in 30 seconds by creating a Nimiq account here. Pura Vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[An Environmental Mission Worth Supporting]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq is joining YouTuber Mr Beast in his efforts to plant 20 Million Trees and we need the help of the Nimiq Community. When you donate $1 to plant one tree using the Nimiq Web Shop, the Nimiq Foundation will match this by donating an extra tree on your behalf.  Why This Matters Right now, the planet is facing its greatest threat since human existence. For many years, scientists have been predicting that climate change would dramatically influence the future of humanity. That future appears to have arrived, with news channels commonly reporting record temperatures, greater number of storms, floods, hurricanes and the destruction of the world’s coral reefs due to climate-induced coral bleaching. For the first time in history, regular people can actually see the impact of climate change and, even worse, all this is happening much faster than many people thought possible. Scientists now have little doubt that with the current rates of warming, humanity and the world’s biodiversity faces a bleak future. There is still time to roll back the devastation of mankind’s carbon emissions over the last 100 years. However, time is short. A report by Breakthroughconcluded that, by 2050, the majority of the world’s population would be subjected to lethal temperatures 20 days a year, a reduction in global agricultural yields by 20%, the collapse of the Amazon ecosystem and a rise in sea levels by 0.5 meters. If these projections turn out to be true, we could be at the start of a mass extinction within our own lifetimes.  How To Rollback Carbon Emissions? Plant Loads of Trees Nimiq was founded with a strong vision to re-imagine what a blockchain project can be by making charity a priority through supporting projects focused on high social and environmental impact. It’s what Team Nimiq likes to call ‘responsible blockchain development’. Nimiq’s passion for environmental preservation comes from its strong presence in Costa Rica, one of the most biodiverse places on the planet, where the team spends a significant amount of time coding in the jungles of Central America. Caption: Nimiq's Nerd Campus in the Costa Rican Jungle When it comes to tackling climate change, Team Nimiq are certainly avid readers of researchers like Tom Crowther, who is the senior author of scientific papers like “The global tree restoration potential” in Science magazine.  Nimiq is also a strong supporter of Mr. Crowther’s idea that “Our study shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today”. That’s why it was clear that Team Nimiq would support the #TeamTree challenge set by YouTuber Mr Beast to plant 20 million trees by 2020. Use Your NIM To Take A Stand Against Climate Change Team Nimiq calls on all Nimiq community members to support this great cause by heading over to the Nimiq shop and for every $1 tree donated using the Web Shop, Team Nimiq will donate another $1 to the #TeamTrees Challenge to plant one tree. We will keep the promotion open until November 31st, when we will count the trees donated in the Web Shop and proceed to donate the money to TeamTrees. The results will be shared publicly on the website of TeamTrees and announced on Nimiq’s Twitter account. Let’s help save the planet one tree at a time. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[NimiqX, NimiqChina and Community Hackathon Organization]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to another meeting report from the Community Funding Board. The Nimiq Community has been growing a lot lately and the board is well aware of it. During this meeting we discussed two proposals from the community, continued organizing the upcoming Community Hackathon, talked about the Nimiq Community Hosting Service and rewarded users for their valuable contribution to the community. Let’s get to it! Proposals NimiqX NimiqX is one of the oldest projects of the Nimiq Ecosystem. Founded by active community member Miao, this website serves multiple purposes: API for projects looking to quickly gather information related to Nimiq without running their own node. Mining Calculator for users looking to plan their mining activities. Charts and Statistics about the Nimiq Network for users who are interested in looking further into Nimiq’s operation. After a quick discussion, board members agreed that NimiqX does provide a lot of value to the community. This proposal has been approved, and will receive funding of 393 USD in NIM. NimiqChina This proposal comes from Miao, the same user who asked for funding for NimiqX. Miao is fluent in Chinese and so, he has been helping promote the project in Asian Communities by translating content to Mandarin. He is requesting funding to keep the servers online for the next year. The Board also agreed there is a lot of value on this website and noticed how humble Miao’s proposal is, since he does not ask for funding for himself, but only to pay for the server costs. This proposal has been approved with funding of 298 USD in NIM. Nimiq Web Services Update As you might remember from previous blog posts, the funding board has been discussing about a way to host projects (like NimiqX, NimiqChina and many others) under the same infrastructure in order to reduce costs and facilitate operation of community projects. This time Board Member Maestro gave an update on this effort: Him and Vasconcelos have been researching and agreed on a possible hosting platform. In order to test a realistic scenario, the board agreed to accept Miao’s NimiqX together with Albermonte’s Tipbot as part of a first trial for the Nimiq Community Infrastructure Tasks Force. The IF Task Force is formed by experienced sysadmins from the community and Team Nimiq. This will allow the Nimiq IF Group to get a first testing phase with trusted and knowledgeable developers from the community like Miao and Albermonte. Community Awards This month we want to reward the effort and support from the following users: Nimiq DJ Hektor Palme You can find him playing some tunes at his Theta channel. He runs frequent giveaways and supports adoption of Nimiq one beat at a time. The board agreed to reward him with 10’000 NIM for his support. Noviopay by Kaspar_NL Dutch developer Kaspar_NL surprised us with this nice app to request donations. It is simple, yet useful and perfectly showcases how to use Nimiq in a project. We will reward Kaspar with 10’000 NIM for his work. Thanks and BUIDL on! Albatross Staking Calculator by Ken_Blazer Team Nimiq released information about how staking could look like in Nimiq 2.0 and immediately Ken_Blazer got to work. He created a useful staking calculator to calculate potential rewards on Nimiq 2.0 as well as different variables of the rewards system. Check it out here. We want to reward Ken_Blazer with 25’000 NIM for his work. New Sticker Pack by qdelac Let’s face it, we all love stickers. The new Sticker Pack by qdelac is just awesome. Members of the Nimiq Traders Telegram Group have been using them a lot and it definitely can paint a picture in a discussion. We appreciate a lot your effort qdelac and reward you with 4’000 NIM. Miner Hub by Albermonte New people find out about Nimiq everyday, they learn transition to staking is coming and get eager to start mining before that happens. Albermonte is here to help with the new Miner Hub, the easiest way to start mining with Nimiq. If you are not mining now, check it out! We reward Albermonte with 25’000 NIM for this super helpful and beautiful app. Willersonsp supporting Brazilian community Nimiq is going places and one of those places is Brazil! Community member willersonsp has been extra active helping portuguese-speaking community members with tutorials. Thanks for your help educating other users, we would like to reward you with 4'000 NIM. FonsL and his awesome Nimiq OASIS Infographic FonsL has been supporting the community for a while with cool designs and this time he created a clear and nice infographic about Nimiq OASIS. Even though we have a running competition for Nimiq OASIS infographics designers, we would like to reward FonsL with 5’000 NIM for creating this one out of pure love before the contest was even announced. Community Coding Contest The last topic discussed was the upcoming Coding Contest. We agreed that the contest will take place sometime next month to allow developers to prepare. The Board discussed some potential ideas. The most promising are: Nimiq payments module for Catarse: Catarse is an open source crowdfunding platform. It has a modular system that allows for adding alternative payment systems and NIM could be a good option. Vanity address generator: A suggestion on creating an address generator based on existing tools like the nimiq vanity wallet and the Nimiq Identicon Builder to allow users to customize their address to a higher degree. If you have more ideas remember you can share them in the Project Ideas section of the Forum. A lot have been going on and we had many things to share this month. Now we are excited about next month’s meeting. Remember you can send a proposal by following these instructions.  We would like to end by thanking the entire Nimiq Community for being one of the most unique, creative and supportive communities in the Crypto Space.  See you in the next one, Nimiq Community Funding Board]]></content:encoded>

The organization’s goal is to promote kindness through the celebration of people, organizations, and brands that are helping shape a better future through better products, enriching content, education, events, and grassroots community building. Kindhumans will leverage partnerships through collaborations with various causes, athletes, experts, and influencers to create the greatest impact possible by always giving back and looking forward to a better, more positive and more sustainable future. “Kindness. Pass it on.” Campaign The “Kindness. Pass it on.” campaign is an online giveback program that aims to spread kindness and raise an initial goal of $1M for good causes. In hopes of growing the campaign and kindness movement, Kindhumans call-to-action, or “Kindness Challenge,” encourages participants to take three kind actions that result in a kinder world and have a measurable, positive impact. The campaign steps are: Pay it forward by recognizing the kind humans in your life by sending them a message of thanks or kindness along with a Kindhumans sticker pack the company calls a “badge” of kindness; Give back to a cause with a direct and measurable impact through every purchase made. Current partnerships with accredited charitable organizations include: Leave No Trace (educating kids about the environment), National Forest Foundation (promoting the health of National Forests), and 501CTHREE (providing clean drinking water to residents of Flint, MI); Pass it on by nominating three friends to take the challenge and grow the kindness movement! The process is fun, family-friendly and helps strengthen the positive bond in our global community by connecting people through simple, thoughtful acts of kindness. Cryptography and transparency Being kind, collecting donations and pursuing a greater purpose is all about trust — and trust is fostered by transparency and traceability. Nimiq can help. Transactions stored on the blockchain are basically immutable, but moreover, each transaction can also carry additional information that is immutable as well. This fundamental feature of an open and decentralized blockchain will help Kindhumans to achieve cryptography-based transparency. Information can not be altered or deleted going forward, thus allowing creation of an immutable reference. Cryptography, created to encrypt data is now part of fostering transparency. How beautiful is that? Kindhumans will record the hash of published reports on the Nimiq Blockchain and provide a link on their transparency page so that the public can verify the genuine, untampered nature of each report. Kindhumans and Nimiq want to give back In wanting to “give back”, Kindhumans’ and Nimiq’s spirits are well aligned. Since its conception, Nimiq has been built with the mindset of helping others through the creation of a better kind of money. As part of this effort, Nimiq supported a proposal on bringing cryptocurrencies for day-to-day transactions to communities disconnected from the global banking system, giving them the ability to transact with the world without needing to rely on a middleman. You can read more on the crypto adoption proposal or visit cryptoadoption.io. To further manifest the spirit of “giving back”, Nimiq has immutably committed 2% of the total coin supply to supporting good cause initiatives with high social or ecological impact. Together, with purpose Kindhumans is aiming to build a marketplace for ethical products guided by the principle of delivering a more responsible, mindful, and holistic consumer platform. These plans offer scope for joint growth, as Nimiq is committed to providing the best non-custodial crypto payment experience and will prioritize projects with a greater purpose. This would equip Kindhumans’ mindful platform with the means of accepting the most modern form of payment. Nimiq is excited to support Kindhumans on various levels and looks forward to making a positive impact wherever we can.]]></content:encoded>

The period covered since the last report is August 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019.

Assets and use of funds Assets The Nimiq Project continues to hold a variety of liquid and non-liquid assets. The 9.9% stake in German WEG Bank AG is a new acquisition. Note that the crypto assets are considered not liquid.

As of July, contractor compensations were restructured to include goal-driven components so that the monthly burn-rate as of the end of July is down to around US$ 170K (excluding one-time or irregular expenditures and short-term contract expenses). NIM supply and distribution In this second part, we would like to describe the distribution of NIM tokens, showing details of accounts and vesting contracts as well as the circulating and total supply as of the end of July. Quick view Live summary of NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply.txt Just the current circulating NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply/circulating/nim.txt The total final NIM supply in ~100 years by design of the Nimiq Blockchain protocol: 21'000'000'000 NIM Details NIM activated from Token Sale NET (5% of final total): As of June 30 2019, 845’097’617 NIM have been activated from NET and are part of the circulating supply. The remaining difference (~204'902'383 NIM) that has not been activated from NET is visible at account addresses NQ69 9A4A MB83 HXDQ 4J46 BH5R 4JFF QMA9 C3GN and NQ15 MLJN 23YB 8FBM 61TN 7LYG 2212 LVBG 4V19. Though the deadline for activating NIM has long passed, Nimiq is processing requests on a case by case, manual basis (applying the same conditions of KYC/AML). Being conservative, Nimiq considers them part of the circulating supply. All other NIM are either acquired through mining or released through a vesting contract (all vesting durations are measured from April 14 2018). NIM minable (88% of final total): 18'480'000'000 NIM over ~100 years. As of the end of June (~12.3% of final total): 2’593’189’595 NIM, part of circulating supply.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq’s Community Funding initiative was created to provide support, mentorship and necessary seed funding to community developers who want to create NIM-based projects and add to Nimiq’s growing ecosystem. However, Nimiq like every other crypto project has finite resources and this means that only the very best ideas and concepts can be backed. So, who decides which community projects will be backed? The Community Funding Board does. What is the community funding board? Nimiq’s vision is to grow this initiative with an ethos of ‘by the community, for the community’. That’s why the Community Funding Board is made up of three community representatives who, together with three members from the team, analyze and make judgments on which community proposals are to be supported. The Community Funding Board is set to play an important role in the future growth of the Nimiq ecosystem and that is why it’s important for all Nimiq community members to vote for Board candidates who share their vision for Nimiq. Go vote It’s your vote, your voice, and every vote matters! Key information To vote, head over to voting.nimiq.community and select your three favorite candidates. Thanks Chugwig (current community representative, running for election again) for the voting app. You can also use an alternative version of the site, built by Smitop (current community representative, running for election again). Bios for each candidate can be found in the Nimiq Forum. Vote weightings are directly proportional to the amount of NIM in your wallet (as of August 1st at 06:00 UTC). Voting has begun and will end on July 31 at 23:59 UTC. Vote weightings will be determined by a snapshot of NIM wallet balances when the voting process ends. A designated voting address means you can select your top 3 favorite candidates and submit your vote for just one Luna. Make a difference “Voting is not only our right. It is our power” — Loung Ung Any democratic process is only as strong as the levels of participation. If you share our belief in Nimiq’s bright future, then make sure you don’t lose your right to have your say in who will represent you in the next Nimiq Community Funding Board. #GetOutTheVote Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A collaboration with Bidali]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq is excited to announce a collaboration with the Canadian crypto payment processor Bidali. As an immediate outcome, this collaboration allows Nimiq users to buy items and services from known brands such as Starbucks, Uber, Amazon, and even Bubba Gump Shrimp Co using gift cards from Bidali’s website or NimiqGiftCards.com. How does it work? “Nimiq is so easy to use, but so far the Nimiq Shop has been the only place I can actually buy something.” Use your NIM everywhere! The Bidali gift card service opens the door for Nimiq users to buy from over 150 merchants in 4 countries: USA, UK, Australia, and Canada. From a cup of coffee to the latest album of your favorite band, your NIM now holds the potential of buying almost anything you want! This marks the first step into the tangible world and opens a wide range of new options on how to use your NIM. Bidali’s gift card service requires a minimum of $50 when buying with NIM. Users should expect a confirmation email in approximately 30 minutes as Bidali is using Changelly in the backend which can take up to 30 minutes to confirm transactions. What about the Nimiq Shop? Aside from NIM being accepted on Bidali’s website, Team Nimiq began a technical collaboration with Bidali. Thanks to this partnership, Bidali has provided access to their SDK which allows for any website to use their backend to buy gift cards. The Nimiq Shop is and always will be the best place to buy your Nimiq Swag. It is also the place where we showcase the most recent version of the Nimiq WooCommerce plugin and the Nimiq Checkout, allowing you to conveniently pay in NIM directly from your browser enjoying the Nimiq Checkout experience. Considering that the Nimiq Shop also double-functions as demo site in itself, Team Nimiq built a new “Nimified” site for Bidali: NimiqGiftCards.com Thanks to Nimiq being native to the web and Bidali’s JavaScript-based framework, it was possible to integrate Nimiq and Bidali quickly and seamlessly with a few efficient lines of code. This integration is a testament of how fast, easy and convenient it is to create web apps using Nimiq. NimiqGiftCards.com was built as side-project by frontend developer Sören, you can find the code on GitHub. Just the beginning With a new website on the way, Bidali’s collaboration couldn’t have reached Nimiq at a better time. For the long-term, we’re analyzing possible benefits Bidali could get from the non-custodial crypto-fiat bridge Nimiq OASIS, and, for Nimiq, potential benefits from Bidali’s financial backend and distribution channels. We want to thank Bidali for their amazing and quick support and welcome them into the Nimiq Ecosystem, the Nimiq Family. Pura Vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Fifth meeting]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been five months since the official formation of Nimiq’s Community Project Funding Board, meaning that the current Community Representatives seats will be available for election. Team Nimiq would like to thank all three of our current Community Representatives SirChef, Chugwig, and Smitop for their dedication, support, and help in establishing the processes which will serve the Community Project Funding Board in the future. We’d also like to thank you all in advance for your assistance with a smooth transition from the current Board to the new one. The active Nimiq Community is one of the things that makes Nimiq great. The first five months of Nimiq’s Community Funding initiative has seen 17 community projects, nine of which have been fully funded, five partially, and three are pending a resubmission to the Board with proposal modifications. In total, nearly 10 million NIM have been pledged to support community-driven projects. In addition, extra developer rewards may be granted based on the successful execution of ongoing community projects. The latest Nimiq Community Project Funding meeting was held on June 14, 2019, and Team Nimiq would like to thank the community representatives and the wider community for their thoughts and input on this months submitted proposals. We’d also like to thank the proposal submitters for sharing their ideas and their proactive participation in the Nimiq ecosystem. Before summarizing the meeting, we’d like to give you a quick update on the status of community funding during the first Board term: The voting process for the next board The meeting was dominated by a discussion on the voting process to select the next Nimiq Community Representatives for the second Nimiq Community Project Funding Board. It was agreed that: The voting period would last two weeks. Nimiq will be able to vote using voting.nimiq.community (Shout-out to Chugwig for the hard work creating the app). Vote weightings would be directly proportional to the amount of NIM that voters hold e.g. if you held 1M NIM and voted for candidate X, you would have allocated 1M votes to candidate X. Vote weightings would be determined by a snapshot of NIM wallet balances when the voting process ends. There is a designated voting address and users will be able to specify candidates by sending a transaction of one Luna and using the extra data. Plural voting is allowed with one account being able to vote for up to 3 candidates. Results will be shown publicly and will be used as an input for the current board to decide the next Community representatives. Nominated candidates The Board also decided that nominated candidates participating in the Community Representative election should create a 240-word bio about themselves and outline why the Nimiq community should vote for them. These submissions should then be sent to community [at] nimiq [dot] com for distribution before the voting process begins. Key election dates For voters: The snapshot of Nimiq blockchain will occur on August 1st at 06:00 UTC. This will validate the NIM balances for all Nimiq wallet addresses and determine the vote weightings for each wallet during the elections. One NIM equals one vote. Therefore, if you have 1M NIM in your wallet at the time of the snapshot, your wallet has a voting weight of one million votes. Voting will open on July 16 at 00:00 UTC and end on July 31 at 23:59 UTC. New Community Representatives for the Nimiq Community Project Funding Board will be announced in August. For candidates: Candidate bios must be submitted to community [at] nimiq [dot] com before July 15. Proposal evaluation During the meeting, the Board also discussed and evaluated two proposals submitted by the Nimiq community. VRimiq Project purpose: To create a Nimiq focused VR social space to bring Nimiq supporters together. VRimiq is envisioned to run directly in a browser on any device and with or without a VR-headset. Development stage: Concept. Project team: Telegram user arnputz. Previously evaluated? No. The project requested the following funding: Server costs for 1 year: 3M NIM Dev of first rooms: 7M NIM Domain & advertising: 1M NIM Promotions: 1M NIM Total: 12M NIM The Board highlighted that server costs appeared to be exceptionally high considering that the VR rooms proposed were being built in HTML, which should be pretty quick and easy to create. Also, USD value for server costs was not given by the proposal submitter. It was also recognized that the development work for the first VR rooms should be a developer award and not a flat upfront fee (as per previous guidance). It was agreed that the Board would request a modification to the VRimiq proposal and that arnputz would be asked to focus the proposal on the first three months of development. Nimiq Ledger Nano S promotion Project purpose: To run more Nimiq Ledger giveaway promotions with Twitter influencers. Development stage: Concept. Project team: Tzujm33 Previously evaluated? No. Funding requested: Ledger postage costs. The Board unanimously agreed that community-driven efforts could add significant value to Nimiq’s overall social media exposure. It was agreed that Tzujm33 would be approved to giveaway up to three Nimiq Ledgers per Twitter influencer, Nimiq would be in charge of dispatching Ledgers to recipients and that Tzujm33 would be gifted a free ledger for their efforts. In short, the Board approved this proposal in full. Please refer to this document if you would like to participate in the “Nimiq Influencer & Website Outreach Process”. Team Nimiq community board members Internal voting at Team Nimiq will determine the three Community Board Members from the team. However, at least one board member from the team will serve a second term to ensure a smooth transition between boards. Do something meaningful If you share Nimiq’s vision for creating a simple, secure and censorship-resistant cryptocurrency, then we’d love to hear your proposal for funding and how your project can be supported. Just read our proposal submission guide and email your idea to proposals [at] nimiq [dot] com. Team Nimiq is very excited to see how the Community Project Funding Board develops and we’d like to thank you in advance for casting your election votes to ensure that the best possible Nimiq Community Representatives are elected to the next Board. Pura Vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[New report for the period following June 2019]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In line with the last report, we would like to present an updated overview of the assets and use of funds for the Nimiq project, as well as updated details of the distribution of NIM tokens with circulating and total supply. The period covered since the last report is July 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020. The report indicates a stabilization of burn-rate as well as no significant change in net assets due to the beneficial clearing of the loan. Assets and use of funds Assets The Nimiq Project continues to hold a variety of liquid and non-liquid assets. The 9.9% stake in German TEN31 (WEG) Bank AG is valued at original participation valuation and does not reflect potential increases in such valuation. As of the end of July 2020 the Nimiq Project had the following assets (valued at the time of finalizing this publication): 296.2 BTC ~ US$ 3.2 Mio 3’791.4 ETH ~ US$ 1.3 Mio 65.0 Mio NIM (besides genesis NIM) ~ US$ 0.3 Mio Fiat (EUR, USD) ~ US$ 2.6 Mio Real Estate ~ US$ 1.1 Mio Stake in TEN31 (WEG) Bank ~ EUR 3.5 Mio (US$ 3.7 Mio) Reserves (see "Use of funds") ~ US$ (-1.5 Mio) Total Net Assets: ~US$ 10.7 Mio  Use of funds The use of funds from the end of June 2019 up to the end of July 2020 breaks down as follows: Product Development Contracting, Compensations: This includes all research, design, implementation and maintenance work and consultation of third parties regarding the Nimiq protocol and apps related to nimiq.com. The report indicates a further reduction in contracting expenses due to renegotiated compensation schemes (not a reduction in team size). An additional amount of ~$260K is reserved and due pending achievement of development goals (release of Nimiq 2.0, etc). ~US$ 1’309.8K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~35.0% of total Marketing, Listings, Content, Community: This includes expenses related to creating marketable video and written content, branding, listing integration fees, swag production, community rewards and influencer review fees. It also includes community programs such as the Bug Bounty Program, Community Project Funding with a reserve of $50K for the next 12 months. An additional amount of $120K is reserved and due pending listing related liquidity provisions. ~US$ 415.2K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~11.1% of total Legal, Administration, Taxes: This includes legal and administrative expenses regarding corporate maintenance, contract review, accounting, professional support from MME Legal | Tax | Compliance, Lara Legal Corp, Sielva Management, Grant Thornton Bankrevision AG and Lucris Finance AG and additional task specific legal counseling i.e. for acquiring payment service provider licenses, trademarking, terms of services, privacy policies, etc. ~US$ 156.4K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~4.2% of total Digital Operations, Equipment: This includes expenses related to hosting, hardware, software, licensing, and other development tools and platforms. ~US$ 112.4K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~3.0% of total Travel, F&B: This includes expenses related to transportation, hotel, food/beverage, and team building. ~US$ 85.9K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~2.3% of total Physical Operations, Rent: This includes expenses related to rent and maintenance. ~US$ 134.0K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~3.6% of total Extraordinary: Investments, Infrastructure: This includes paying off the loan and beginning setup of the technology and infrastructure as a service for Nimiq OASIS. An additional $1 Mio is reserved for infrastructure, liquidity and market making for OASIS and related services. A further $100k is reserved as part of an anticipated TEN31 Bank dilution event. ~US$ 1’526.3K (fiat + crypto equivalent at time of expense) ~40.8% of total Total Use of Funds: ~US$ $3’740.0K ($2’213.7 non-extraordinary) In addition to the expense reductions reported in the 2019 transparency report, Nimiq was able to further reduce legal (minus ~27%), digital operations (minus ~10%), physical operations (minus ~29%) and travel/f&b (minus ~57%) related expenses (time frame adjusted). The monthly burn-rate as of the end of July is holding at around US$ 170K (excluding extraordinary expenses). The further reduction in contractor expenses (from renegotiated terms, not downsizing) has been offset by an increase in ordinary communication and project visibility related expenses. The reduced burn-rate can be expected to reasonably turn up from this level as goal-driven rewards get triggered and travel for hackathons and industry events is expected to pick up again following the Covid-19 disruption. NIM supply and distribution In this second part, we would like to describe the distribution of NIM tokens, showing details of accounts and vesting contracts as well as the circulating and total supply as of the end of July. Quick view Live summary of NIM supply: http://nim.sh/stats/supply.txt The total final NIM supply in ~100 years by design of the Nimiq Blockchain protocol: 21'000'000'000 NIM Details NIM activated from Token Sale NET (5% of final total): As of the end of July 2020, 855’097’617 NIM have been activated from NET and are part of the circulating supply. The remaining difference (~194’902’382 NIM) that has not been activated from NET is visible at account addresses NQ69 9A4A MB83 HXDQ 4J46 BH5R 4JFF QMA9 C3GN and NQ15 MLJN 23YB 8FBM 61TN 7LYG 2212 LVBG 4V19. Though the deadline for activating NIM has long passed, Nimiq is processing requests on a case by case, manual basis (applying the same conditions of KYC/AML). Being conservative, Nimiq considers them part of the circulating supply. All other NIM are either acquired through mining or released through a vesting contract (all vesting durations are measured from April 14 2018). NIM minable (88% of final total): 18'480'000'000 NIM over ~100 years since April 2018. As of the end of July (~22% of final total): 4'609'881'537 NIM, part of circulating supply. The live amount is available here: http://nim.sh/stats/supply/mined/nim.txt Nimiq Foundation (Project, 2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ09 VF5Y 1PKV MRM4 5LE1 55KV P6R2 GXYJ XYQF. Vesting is 26'250'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 105’000’000 NIM are part of the circulating supply. These funds have not been touched. ImpactX Foundation (Charity, 2% of final total): 420'000'000 NIM at vesting contract address NQ19 YG54 46TX EHGQ D2R2 V8XA JX84 UFG0 S0MC. Vesting is 21'000'000 NIM every 6 months over 10 years. First vesting was in October 2018, as of the end of July, 84’000’000 NIM are part of the circulating supply. These funds have not been touched. Nimiq Team & Early Contributors (2.5% of final total): 525'000'000 NIM at 82 vesting contract addresses, see https://pastebin.com/raw/1eDwDF45. Vesting schedule A (for creators) is 35'000'000 NIM total every 6 months over 3 years and vesting schedule B was 157'500'000 NIM total for month 3 and month 6 (team, early contributors and future team member allocation).

            <description><![CDATA[Proposal process upgrades, board decentralization, proactive rewards & more]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Unless you sealed yourself in a nuclear bunker back in 2019, you will probably know that the world has a teeny tiny problem right now. All this has meant that a few billion people are now living in lockdown, with many having their lives turned upside down.  The Nimiq Community Funding Board has not been immune from the effects of COVID-19, with some community representatives living in the worst affected regions of the world. This meeting was therefore delayed one week to try to accommodate for the crisis.  Ginghis, from Italy, was forced to sit out of the latest meeting. Fortunately, SirChef, one of the Community Representative alumni, was able to fill in for him.  Matheo, a French representative from Team Nimiq, could not make it either. Sven from Team Nimiq managed to step up to take this board seat to ensure that the Nimiq Community Funding Board could operate properly, pandemic or not. Team Nimiq would like to remind everyone in the community that we are in this pandemic together. We’ll get through this by pulling together and will emerge stronger because of it. True character is forged in the face of adversity. Proposal Process Improvements The first part of the meeting was focused on improving and streamlining the way the Board evaluates Community Funding Board proposals. In the past, community members submitted proposals to the Board via email to proposals@nimiq.com. However, the Board decided that all new proposals should instead be posted on the Nimiq forum from now on. The logic here is that this will further increase the transparency of the Board and empower Nimiq community members to share their thoughts on submitted proposals.  So, if you are interested in submitting a proposal to the Nimiq Community Funding Board, then do make sure you check out the updated instructionson the Nimiq forum. Once the Board receives a proposal, it is evaluated in the next Community Funding Board meeting. If it is approved straight away, a member of the Nimiq Community Funding Board will reach out to the proposal submitter to sort out any funding or mentorship awarded by the Board.  In the event that the Board decides that a proposal modification is needed, then the proposal submitter will be contacted and a Board member will tell them the exact changes needed to have their proposal approved. Some proposals may be rejected. In this case, the Board commits to notifying the proposal submitter in writing. What about decisions outside of meetings? Some decisions are made outside of meetings. This makes the process quick and easy instead of having to wait one month for the next meeting. An example of this kind of decision is actually this blog post, which is written after the meeting and then shared with community representatives for approval by everybody in the board. These decisions and suggestions are voted upon through communication channels like email, or the Community Board’s Telegram and Discord channels.  If consensus is reached then the suggestion will automatically be accepted. If there is not a full consensus then discussions on modifications will happen offline and proposal changes will be suggested. If there is unanimous agreement then consensus will be reached or it will go down to a Community Funding Board Member vote. Any decision here will be made via a majority vote. Proactive Rewards The Board then turned its attention to the hard work of Nimiq community members over the last month. @Serb was recognized for his great work with running NimiqBalkans and teaming up with @EB and Tomkha to set up a new mining pool. If that wasn’t enough, the guys are also talking about setting up a website to further support and strengthen that initiative.  The Board decided to award 30K NIM to @Serb and 30K NIM to @EB to recognize their efforts this month.  Discussion then turned to Nimizuela and the efforts of @Ralv and @Bushwack to widen Nimiq adoption in Venezuela. @Ralv is actually a compensated community manager over there, however, @Bushwack’s contribution is purely out of love for the project. To recognize this amazing effort, the Board decided to award him 50K NIM. Decentralization of the Community Funding Board So far, the Nimiq Community Funding Board has been operated in a pretty centralized way with key day-to-day operations being carried out by a few Nimiq Team members. The Board decided to decentralize all this by spreading out tasks between members. This includes things like this blog post, meeting minutes, responding to proposals, reviewing bounties, getting the NIM addresses from people who have been allocated proactive rewards, payment of those rewards, meeting agenda creation and more. A back up person was also assigned to every task to ensure the continued smooth operation of the Board.  This move not only shares Board responsibilities amongst its members, but also means that the Board will run in a much more decentralized manner from now on. Assigning back up people to responsibility also means that the Board is a lot more robust when it comes to its day to day operations. Finally There is no doubt the world faces an uncertain future. Amongst that backdrop it is easy to despair. However, the Nimiq Funding Board has attempted to take a more proactive approach and to take the steps necessary to ensure that the Board continues to serve the interests of the Nimiq community. We’ll get through this together and come out of it stronger. Pura Vida Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Team Nimiq is thrilled to release a major update to our apps that will significantly improve how users can use their NIM]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The update comes packed with new features, improved and hardened security concepts, and an open API that allows third-party apps to integrate Nimiq features and handle NIM directly in the browser. And it’s all wrapped in a brand new user interface making it easier than ever to use your NIM. This post will focus on the top features from a technical perspective. Stay tuned for an in-depth article about the UX/UI/product progress and an article about features and releases in the next weeks. So, what’s new? Accounts with multiple addresses New architecture and Ledger integration Nimiq Login Files Changeable passwords Logout interface QR-Code generator and scanner Open API for 3rd-party integration Nimiq Checkout Message signing support One Account, many Addresses With standards-compliant BIP44 private-key derivation, one seed now supports an infinite number of addresses. That means, with all new accounts you can manage more than one address under one account. For a more in-depth introduction into Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets, please refer to this article. With this update, it’s now easy to get your funds, payments, and transactions organized without the need to backup and store a key for each of those addresses. Instead, it’s only one account and one backup. While enjoying this convenience, you still have the freedom to create several multi-address accounts and, for example, separate your savings from your daily allowance and your business expenses. This way, you can store the backups of each of these accounts accordingly. Multiple addresses are now also supported for Ledger hardware wallets! Old Accounts, New Accounts With the introduction of multi-address accounts, conventional single-address accounts turn into legacy accounts. They are still supported but will not inherit new features such as the Login File and will not be developed further in the future. Team Nimiq recommends all users to upgrade by creating a new multi-address account and transfer their funds. Keyguard and Ledger The overall architecture of the Keyguard has been reworked leading to a new structure: The Nimiq Hub handles and stores your accounts, i.e. the addresses and labels belonging to each account, but never the keys. The keys are stored in a dedicated, highly secure location, such as the Ledger hardware wallet or the Keyguard. The Nimiq Hub is positioned in front of the various key storage solutions, providing a unified interface for users to manage all their accounts that might be associated with multiple keys from multiple locations. Thus, users will always see the same, familiar user interface wherever they make a payment. Keyguard security The Keyguard is now more secure than ever. It is served with strict Content-Security-Policies enabled, as well as other relevant security headers (more details can be found here). Additionally, all scripts and styles in the Keyguard domain are now loaded into the browser with integrity checksums, a technique allowing the browser to verify the authenticity of the downloaded files. Deeper Ledger integration With this new architecture, the Ledger and Keyguard accounts are now moved behind the same abstraction layer. Thus, from the user’s perspective, a Keyguard account behaves the same as a Ledger account: They can have multiple addresses, can be renamed and both kinds of accounts can be used with 3rd party apps accessing them via the Nimiq Hub. Login and logout After creating a new Nimiq Account, you will be offered to download a Login File. It’s a safe and easy way to back up your private key. It’s easy because it means you just download a small image instead of needing to write down the 24 Recovery Words right away. The file comes with a QR code and thus can be printed and easily scanned with your phone or webcam instead of entering the 24 words again. And it looks good, too: At the same time, it’s secure because your password protects the key inside your Login File. That means the key is securely encrypted as opposed to the Recovery Words that are plain text. If somebody gets their hands on them, they can steal your funds while the Login File only works together with your password. Thanks to the new Login File, it is easy to store your backup and thus log out of your savings account when you don’t need it. In addition, the Login File makes it easy to log into your account on somebody else’s machine, do transactions and payments, and log out when you’re done, leaving no trace. Logging out means removing all account-related data from that device, including your key. As the password becomes more critical for an account’s security, a password-changing functionality was implemented. In contrast to centralized solutions, where a password change would lead to an update in a database, a Nimiq password change results in the creation of a new Login File, encrypted with the new password. For more details on the Login File and the underlying ImageWallet standard, see this blog post. QR-Codes It’s easier now to share your address or request a transaction by sharing and scanning QR-Codes directly from within the updated Nimiq Safe. The QR-Code functionality allows for a basic over-the-counter experience. While designated interfaces and apps are planned, easy and fast in-person NIM transactions between strangers are now possible. Open API By including a script tag or installing an NPM package, requests can be made to the open Nimiq Hub API, allowing app developers to create entire payment applications on top of the Nimiq infrastructure. From the user’s perspective, it’s the same convenient user interface that will perform the security-related operations across different apps without passing private information to consumer apps. See github.com/nimiq/hub for details, how to get started, and in-depth documentation. Nimiq Checkout The newly added checkout function opens a specialized user interface that has been optimized for payments during checkout processes in shops compared to the general method of signing a transaction. It allows users to pay directly from their browser without having to open a dedicated wallet app. The shop developer can provide the shop’s logo to make the transition from shop to payment even smoother. The signed transaction is returned but also directly sent to the network allowing developers to set up shops without access to a Nimiq node or even to build fully client-side shop solutions. Message signing support Signing of arbitrary messages is now supported. It will allow you to identify yourself and prove ownership over a particular address. Apps or websites can use this functionality to identify you by your Nimiq Address. You and only you can prove ownership of your address as you have the private key of your Nimiq Account — no need to remember new passwords or user names. Team Nimiq is evaluating a single-sign-on feature. More on this in an upcoming post. Try it! Go ahead and create a new Account. Help Nimiq to grow by giving feedback on what you like and what you think could be improved. Share it on Twitter #easynimiq or discuss on Telegramand Discord.

            <description><![CDATA[Revolution in trading cryptocurrencies: Nimiq OASIS achieves direct compatibility between blockchain and banking.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq, together with TEN31 bank, achieved a breakthrough for compatibility between blockchain and traditional banking with the release of the OASIS (Open Asset Swap Interaction Scheme) technology. For the first time, Nimiq OASIS enables a decentralized and therefore secure purchase of cryptocurrencies by bank transfer: from money in your bank account to cryptocurrency in your self-custodial wallet in a few minutes - and vice versa (volume limits apply). All without the need to open an account with a centralized crypto exchange and the associated, usually time-consuming identification process. “We started the Nimiq project to make cryptocurrency accessible, usable, and secure for everyone. It was clear to us that without a technology with which the new cryptocurrencies could easily be bought, sold, or exchanged, there would be no mass market. With Nimiq OASIS we have now overcome this barrier”, says Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, Tech Lead and co-founder of Nimiq. Matthias von Hauff, CEO of TEN31 Bank adds: “OASIS is a revolution in trading with cryptocurrencies. With this project, we have come a lot closer to our goal of making trading with cryptocurrencies easy and offering everyone involved real added value. Even more: the launch is just the beginning of a whole range of possible applications for this technology, both in the B2C and B2B sectors.“ With the OASIS protocol, on one hand, currencies such as Euros, Dollars, or Swiss Francs can be used programmatically like tokens on a blockchain. On the other hand, it creates the fastest, safest, and most efficient way to buy, exchange and sell cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In the B2B area, both decentralized exchanges and OTC services and applications – in fact, all decentralized financial services (DeFi) – can use the OASIS protocol to efficiently process transactions between fiat and cryptocurrencies. The Nimiq Wallet, which is the first application to use the OASIS protocol, is completely browser-based and up to a certain limit does not require registration or the provision of personal data when buying crypto. All the user needs is a European, SEPA-Instant-capable bank account. The cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Nimiq (NIM), the currency of the decentralized payment system Nimiq, can already be purchased and sold at the launch. “In the long term, OASIS opens up the possibility of connecting Nimiq to traditional payment networks. This makes paying with NIM possible in everyday life without retailers having to change their existing infrastructure. The customer can pay in NIM or another cryptocurrency and euros arrive at the retailer”, says TEN31 Bank CEO Matthias von Hauff, describing his vision for the future. As one of the initiators of the non-profit organization Nimiq, Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky sees yet another future driver of the groundbreaking technology: “All profits generated with the OASIS project are invested in the currency of our decentralized payment system NIM and held for the long term through the Nimiq Foundation. With every transaction, the demand leads to a shortage and thus to a higher attractiveness of the currency, but also of the project as such.“ We are very excited to announce the release of OASIS! From this day forward the documentation and API of Nimiq OASIS are open to the public. We will work towards growing the number of applications based on OASIS as well as expanding the reach of the Nimiq OASIS network. For more details on Nimiq OASIS visit the informative page, watch this video and test it in the Nimiq wallet. Pura Vida 🚀 Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq 2.0 Supply Curve Election and Options]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month we published the Nimiq 2.0 Supply Curve Considerations, provided tools to analyze it more easily, discussed it with the Nimiq community and hosted an AMA. Now we want to share with you the next steps in this sensitive process. [UPDATE 2: The follow-up ranking vote concluded on June 8, 2020 and the NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0 has been determined as the "BLUE" curve (community suggestion). See results here.] [UPDATE 1: First vote concluded May 18, 2020 with "YES" on making an adjustment to the NIM supply curve. See results here.] How did we get here? A fundamental aspect of a cryptocurrency is the emission rate of the coin. This is the amount of rewards that participants, be it miners or stakers, receive for supporting the network and validating transactions. During the last year, we noticed increasing requests to consider changing this rate. Changing the rate is serious business since it is potentially related to a lot of different factors like the security of the network, perception of the project to newcomers, incentives for new participants and possible price developments from increasing scarcity. A change in the supply curve clearly impacts the entire Nimiq Ecosystem. This decision has to be taken together. We felt responsible for providing a starting point for this discussion. Thus, we worked with an economic modeling advisor (former Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, now a director at Gemini Finance) who works in asset valuation and advised us in creating the assumptions and restrictions, reducing complexity and identifying reasonable boundaries. The advisor’s suggestions were used as inspiration to write the Nimiq 2.0 Supply Curve Considerations and kickstart these discussions. The Nimiq Community got actively involved and even created tools to analyze and discuss potential supply curves. We also provided a spreadsheet for users to play around and find out what each curve means for them in the short-, medium- and long-run. Discussions were held in a thread of the Nimiq Forum. Soon, we felt the need to have an active discussion to give feedback, so we held an AMA with the team members most knowledgeable regarding this topic to answer all questions of the community.  Based on those discussions and a casual poll we ran in our Twitter account, it is clear that various opinions exist in the community. The poll shows that 63%, the majority, appear in favor of a change, 17% are against it (leaving 20% undecided). For a solid decision process we realized that a formal voting process, that involves the community whilst protecting the project from stalling to a dead end, is necessary. Inspired by community suggestions, we believe we have designed a voting process that allows users to make their voices heard in a fair and transparent way. Things to Consider Before we go on, let’s get some concepts down. Emission Rate One of the most fundamental parameters: the emission - also sometimes referred to as “inflation” - is the number of coins that get added to the supply per time unit. Of course, the higher the emission in the beginning, the lower it has to be towards reaching the emission cap. As prices are built by supply and demand, a higher supply usually means a lower price. So, when looking at the rewards, one should also take the dilution (“inflation”) into account which may affect the price of the coins already in existence. Stock/Flow ratio An interesting aspect to consider is the stock-to-flow ratio ("S/F"). It is the ratio between the current supply and the newly added supply per year. Or, in other words, the number of years it would take to reach the current supply from zero, given the current emission rate. Gold has a S/F ratio of 62, Bitcoin currently of 27.5 and after the upcoming halvening it will be 55. As a higher value relates to less supply being added compared to the stock being available, it is a good measure for scarcity. The current supply curve has a ratio of 3.7. The Next Steps After considering the results from the Twitter Poll and the suggestions from the community in the discussion threads, we came to the following conclusion regarding the voting process: Voting first whether or not the emission rate should change: It cannot be assumed that the entire community wants the supply curve to change. After all, there are a good number of long time stakeholders that have supported the project with the current supply curve. [UPDATE: First vote concluded May 18, 2020 with "YES" on making an adjustment to the NIM supply curve. See results here.] Suggesting an upper and lower bound: To narrow down the endless possibilities of curves, both a soft upper and lower limit were modeled. They now represent the suggested two approaches to lower initial inflation/reward versus higher initial inflation/reward of the curve choices. Feedback from the community: A thoughtful suggestion from the community for a curve between the given bounds was added as a third suggestion in the election. Give the community the option to create an alternative curve: If you strongly feel that none of the three curves presented in the election process is the curve that you would like to see in Nimiq 2.0, then it makes sense for you to vote “I don’t like any of those”. Note that this will come with the attached obligation as outlined in the following item: Prevent the elections from getting stalled: If the majority doesn’t like any of the suggested three curves in the elections, we will give the community a time frame of two weeks to organize and submit an alternative proposal. If this fails, the responsibility to make a final decision falls back on Team Nimiq. Voting time frame: Ten days is the time frame for everyone to submit their votes in each of the two voting rounds. Ranked votings: Instead of voting for a single hard choice this complex topic benefits from users rating the selections from favorite to least favorite which the voting tool will support for the second round. [UPDATE: Vote concluded on June 8, 2020 and the NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0 has been determined as the "BLUE" curve (community suggestion). See results here.] Excluding Nimiq Foundation and ImpactX Charity: The Nimiq Foundation and Nimiq’s ImpactX Charity will not participate in voting with their funds. That way any arguments concerning bias through those entities is prevented. Recorded on the Nimiq Blockchain: Following the proven use case of voting with the Nimiq Blockchain, we are building an application that enables users to vote by sending a transaction with their vote attached as a message. This way we enable anyone to transparently check the votes and create reports. Before the elections are started, a fixed block height is announced that marks the end of the voting. At that exact block height, a snapshot of the blockchain state is taken so that we have the balance of each address that has sent a vote. This approach is standard and solves the problem of voting multiple times by moving funds to a new address. And it has a nice side effect: if you change your mind, just vote again during the voting period, only the last vote counts. One NIM one vote: Every address that votes will be weighted according to the NIM it holds. Age doesn’t matter: Bringing age into play is tricky, in life and also when it comes to voting. Funds may have been moved, which is a normal thing to do with funds. We have reviewed various angles and the safest, most straightforward approach is a simple majority voting via balance. Based on these we came up with this process: How will voting work? We will use the new Nimiq Voting App that we are building right now [UPDATE: the app is deployed. see Voting Procedure Blog for current timeline and voting instructions]. The first vote will determine if the curve will change and thus if there is a second round. The second round is about the specific type of curve that the project should then proceed with. Three options are provided which are explained below. Another option provided is “None of the suggested curves.” If this option wins, it then would require the community to organize and step forward to provide an alternative curve option which would then be voted upon. If such an alternative is not presented within 14 days or following an additional voting round is rejected, the responsibility to make the decision will fall back on Team Nimiq, thus prohibiting this process from entering an endless cycle. As stated above, the NIM held by Nimiq Foundation as well as the ImpactX Foundation will notparticipate in any of the voting. Meet the curves First of all, describing supply curves is complicated. If you want to dive down into the numbers, please read the specific blogpost, this thread in the forum, check out this video explaining the supply curve considerations and sheet and finally try tweaking the numbers yourself in the spreadsheet. From discussions within the team and together with the community, three supply curves have manifested as good candidates to replace the current supply curve. Let’s have a closer look. Disclaimer: We are doing this in an attempt to help users understand more about the curves, this should not be considered financial advice or the team vouching for a specific curve. For purposes of this discussion, the models assume a switch to Proof-of-Stake (and with it any potential new supply curve) on April 14 2020. This is not an actual timeline and all numbers are approximations and subject to implementation adjustments. CURRENT Curve (black dashed): To set the stage for comparison, here the overview for the current supply curve. It has a high emission/reward rate currently around 3’445 NIM per minute which equates to the much debated 28% annual coin supply growth (“inflation”), the main reason for this voting altogether. This emission/reward decreases by -12.04% per year. The current stock-to-flow ratio stands around 3.7 which can be considered very low compared to Gold (62) and BTC (27.5). Here the overview of estimates in time (from switch to PoS) for the coin supply, inflation percentage, staking return percentage and reward per minute: GREEN Curve: The staker’s friend More coins emitted in the beginning means more rewards but also less initial scarcity as well as lower rewards at later stages. While less than the CURRENT supply curve, this one has the highest initial emission rate of all three suggestions. This curve starts at 900 NIM per minute which equates to a first year coin supply growth (inflation) of just over 7%. This emission/reward decreases by -3.15% per year. The initial stock-to-flow ratio stands around 14. Here the overview of estimates in time (from switch to PoS) for the coin supply, inflation percentage, staking return percentage and reward per minute: RED Curve: The HODLer’s choice Less coins emitted in the beginning means more initial scarcity while maintaining a relatively higher reward at later stages. It comes with an initial stock-to-flow ratio of 32 (slightly above BTC). This curve has the lowest initial emission rate of all three suggestions. It starts at 400 NIM per minute which equates to a first year coin supply growth (inflation) of just over 3%. The emission/reward rate of this curve is the most stable of all three suggestions as it decreases by only -0.79% per year. Here the overview of estimates in time (from switch to PoS) for the coin supply, inflation percentage, staking return percentage and reward per minute: BLUE Curve: The balanced one  [UPDATE: Blue is winner of NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0!]  This community suggestion is a balance between high and low, GREEN and RED, with the idea to optimize between initial scarcity and reward amounts over time. It’s initial stock-to-flow ratio is 24. It has an initial emission rate of 525 NIM per minute which equates to a first year coin supply growth (inflation) of just over 4%. The emission/reward rate of this curve is reasonably as it decreases by -1.47% per year. Here the overview of estimates in time (from switch to PoS) for the coin supply, inflation percentage, staking return percentage and reward per minute: What to keep in mind The curve should reach the 21 billion NIM after 100 years from Mainnet start as stated in the original terms of the token generation. The new supply curve should be closer to existing, generally accepted economic ideals, reducing the emission, which has also been requested by multiple community members. We want a competitive staking model that is attractive to the community while reinforcing the security of the decentralized blockchain both in the short as well as longer term. For additional pointers review Nimiq 2.0 Supply Curve Considerations. When voting? [UPDATE 2: The follow-up ranking vote concluded on June 8, 2020 and the NIM supply curve for Nimiq 2.0 has been determined as the "BLUE" curve (community suggestion). See results here.] [UPDATE 1: First vote concluded May 18, 2020 with "YES" on making an adjustment to the NIM supply curve. See results here.] We are finishing fine tuning the voting app right now . Next, we would like to try it out with a test voting round with active community members just to make sure everything is working as expected. We hope to be ready for that by the end of the week. Start making up your mind, get your NIM ready to vote and stay tuned to Nimiq’s Twitter Account where we will announce the voting once everything is ready. We would like to thank all the active community members who participated in the discussions, especially Rob and Big Mac who got particularly involved. We truly appreciate you all! :* Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Fourth meeting]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nimiq is fortunate to have a very engaged and active global community. Over the last months, Team Nimiq has been delighted to see an increasing number of community developers and teams that are working to expand and grow the Nimiq Ecosystem. Together, we can create the most accessible, censorship-resistant payment solution and enable barrier-free value exchange for everyone. The latest Nimiq Community Project Funding Meeting was held on April 27, 2019, and Team Nimiq would like to give special thanks to community representatives, those in the community who provided proposal feedback, and the proposal submitters themselves. Before outlining what was discussed in the meeting, we’d like to provide an update on the status of community funding over the first six-month term and continue to ensure we meet the high standards of transparency that we set ourselves: Key information 2 months left in the current Community Funding Project term. Since the start of the initiative, Team Nimiq has funded or has supported 15 different community projects. Proposal evaluation During the meeting, the Funding Board evaluated and discussed five proposals submitted by the Nimiq community. Nimiq Trust Wallet integration If you have kept up to date with Nimiq’s Medium blog, you’ll know that Nimiq’s integration with TrustWallet was announced on March 27. Team Nimiq would like to give special thanks to Terorie and Vasconcelos for moving ahead with this community funding project and executing it to such a high standard. Project Purpose: To add NIM support for Trust Wallet. Development Stage: Complete. Project Team: Terorie and Vasconcelos. Previously Evaluated? The Board acted quickly when the proposal was submitted and approved in principle before the next Community Funding meeting. Requested funding As the Trust Wallet integration had already been fully complete before the Community Funding meeting, all that remained was to determine the developer rewards for Terorie and Vasconcelos. The Board determined that the amount of NIM requested did not sufficiently reflect the initiative and effort demonstrated by the team’s developers and the developer reward was doubled to 500k NIM total. Trust Wallet integration project was approved and ended up receiving total funding of 750k NIM. NimPay Project purpose: To create a Point of Sale solution to enable physical stores to receive NIM payments. Development stage: Concept. Project team: Discord user Daxby#6103 Requested funding: Hosting and domain costs, free security audit, help with UI/UX and mentorship. The Board identified that Team Nimiq planned to work on a point of sale solution in the future and saw the opportunity to involve Daxby#6103 in its execution. This would provide Daxby#6103 with highly relevant mentorship and the opportunity to play a key role in an like-minded project. The proposal can be considered funded when it comes to Team Nimiq putting aside the time to help upskill community members. Nimoji Project purpose: To review existing Nimoji’s and create new ones. Development stage: Unspecified. Project team: Telegram user @Snrnb. Previously evaluated? No. Requested funding: An amount of NIM/Nimoji was provided but a the total was not specified. Requested funding The Board identified that the Nimoji proposal was more a freelance proposal, rather than a typical Community Finding Project proposal. As a result, the Board modified the proposal in its current form as it fell outside the scope of the Community Funding Board. However, it was agreed that @Snrnb would be contacted about potentially reviewing current Nimoji’s and creating new ones on a freelance basis. For this the Community Funding Board decided to spend 200k NIM hiring SinaRnB in the following way: 100k NIM to review current Nimojis. 100k NIM to create new Nimojis. It was also agreed that the Board would propose that @Snrnb is compensated to create new logos for current and future Community Funding projects. Finally, all members of the Community Funding Board expressed appreciation for @Snrnb’s past work. The board has approved 200k NIM for @Snrnb to be hired to review current Nimojis and to create new ones. PayNIM Project purpose: To provide users with an easy, safe and anonymous way to send or receive NIM using an email address or Telegram. Development stage: Working product. Project team: Discord user homeboy. Previously evaluated? No. The funding requested by PayNIM is broken down below: The Board identified that the project had purchased domains like paynim.app, paynimiq.app and paynim.to nearly a year ago. It was judged that costs for initial domain registration fell outside the scope of the Community Funding initiative given that these domains had already been purchased. Past server costs were also discounted. PayNIM’s proposal stated that part of the project plan was to improve the UX of the website. The Board agreed to provide PayNIM with a UI/UX feedback session with Team Nimiq to help the project. It was also discussed how PayNIM could benefit from a security audit despite the project being close-sourced, which the Board has authorized and funded. It was also agreed that a 200k NIM developer grant would be allocated to PayNIM to incentivize further improvement of the product. Finally, the Board also proposed the funding of a new logo for PayNIM. PayNIM can, therefore, be considered partially funded with the developer receiving a 200k NIM developer grant. Crowdfund platform based on Nimiq Project purpose: Creation of a Nimiq crowdfunding platform and enable users to donate NIM seamlessly. Development stage: Concept. Project team: Discord user @alemos. Previously evaluated? No. The project requested the following funding: The Community Funding Board quickly identified that the proposed project’s name (Nimiq Funding) would need to be changed for legal and ambiguity reasons. The server costs were questioned and the Board highlighted that there was no functioning prototype or Github repository for them to evaluate. The Board reached out to the developers who sent the proposal after the meeting and requested the aforementioned information. A demo was provided a couple of weeks after the meeting and after voting it was decided that the project is indeed interesting and could draw the attention of other developers looking to contribute. For that reason and with the reassurance of the developers releasing a public repository, the Board has decided to partially fund the project with: 30k NIM to cover 6 months of server costs. 10k NIM to buy a Domain that does not contain the word “Nimiq”. The Board will provide seed funding of 40k NIM and is open for further evaluation after 6 months of development. Board transition The Board acknowledged that the term for current Board members would be shortly drawing to a close and the process for Board transition was discussed. It was agreed that the new Board would sit in as observers on the Community Project Funding meeting in June and that the new Board would take control over the meeting in July, with the current Board being on hand to give advise (if required). The Board is also analyzing how to proceed with the selection of new community representatives. Proposal policy change During the meeting, it was agreed that all future proposals submitted for evaluation by the Community Funding Board should include the required server resources and that the costs for these should be in USD. This is to enable the Board to assess these costs quicker and more efficiently. Another decision was to communicate to the Nimiq Community to avoid using the name “Nimiq” in community projects. The Board suggests using the term ‘NIM’ and also encourages projects to get creative with new ideas. As discussed with Nimoji and PayNIM proposals, it was agreed that the Community Funding Board would also adopt a policy of: “Only new work is eligible for a reward or funding” Nimiq wants you If you want to join Team Nimiq and current Nimiq ecosystem projects in enabling the most accessible, censorship-resistant payment solution, then start crafting your proposal for funding today. To get started, just read the community guide on funding proposals and email your PDF to proposals@nimiq.com. Together, we can create a barrier-free value exchange for everyone.

            <description><![CDATA[To mass adoption and beyond!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Team Nimiq is proud to announce the release of the new Nimiq Website! With the launch of this website, we aim to onboard many new users to the Nimiq Blockchain. Long-time supporters will easily find information like the developer center, an extended and detailed roadmap, and a growing list of community apps. Visit nimiq.com and let us know what you think in Telegram, Discord, and Twitter. Nimiq’s visual identity Last year, Nimiq did a refresh of its brand and started a progressive revamp of the Nimiq apps and components. The onboarding flow was a big priority combined with overall improvements making it easier and more intuitive to use Nimiq. You can find the details in this blog post. With that task completed, users are now able to easily create and manage Nimiq accounts with beautiful interfaces. The website was the next logical step for the revamp. The “purple” website was super lightweight and focused on providing easy access for the community to Nimiq resources. Although it is probably the most efficient website you can find, especially in terms of loading time and number of clicks needed to get to the desired content, it was focused on users already familiar with Nimiq and therefore lacked information to welcome and onboard new users. This became one of the last pieces remaining for Nimiq’s brand revamp and the overall simplification of the onboarding flow. A new Website with a new tone The plan to build a new website began at the end of last year. With the goal of welcoming new users and engaging them into creating a Nimiq account, the onboarding experience became a core feature of the new website. The overall website was designed from the start to align with Nimiq’s new visual identity as well as Nimiq’s clear vision, general user experience, and overall tone. You might notice how the Community and the Developer Center stand out through the website. Team Nimiq believes the Nimiq Community deserves a prominent spot because of the important role it plays in the project. The community was also part of the brainstorming/design process from the start, giving us feedback about our plans through the Nimiq Forum and Telegram groups, and getting updates in dedicated VLOGs like this one next: Built for simplicity Nimiq’s new website is designed with simplicity in mind, resulting in an intuitive, refreshing experience. At the same time, it also makes it easier to find resources that are needed to build Nimiq-based apps. On the home page, every section links to details and resources on Nimiq. Every page has multiple points of entry and further links to various resources. This creates the engaging effect of users finding information easily, but also enjoying the experience and finding new content by exploring the website itself. To guide the users through the website, a minimal navigation bar is shown at the top. It invites new users to create an account and provides simple access to the main sections: Apps, Developer and About. The bar disappears when browsing the page to maximize space for its content. Apps: You will find apps not only made by Team Nimiq, but also by the Community. You can also “add your own app” by visiting the Developer Center. Developers: The developer center provides documentation, tutorials, and resources for both experienced devs and new devs just starting to build their own Nimiq-based apps. About: For anyone who wants to learn about Team Nimiq and the Nimiq Community. This is the entry point for users who want to learn more about the non-technical parts of Nimiq, Nimiq’s charity efforts, the roadmap, whilst also giving quick access to blog posts. With this step, we’re gearing up to making Nimiq available to everyone and advancing forward towards cryptocurrency mass adoption and beyond! Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[New community reward schemes & ways to support the Nimiq ecosystem]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Community Funding Board was founded with the vision to support, empower and grow the Nimiq community. This month, the board focused on expanding the scope of the Community Funding Board and deploying additional frameworks to further speed up Nimiq Ecosystem growth. We’d like to thank our community representatives Chugwig, Matt and Wekkel for their time, insights and efforts this month. Without any further ado, we’d like to share the outcomes and decisions made in this meeting. Bounties The Board discussed ways to further involve the Nimiq Community into the development of the Nimiq Ecosystem — especially since the Nimiq Community is home to so many talented developers. The main objective is to make Nimiq more “Open-Sourcy”, with the nice side effect of accelerating the growth of the Nimiq Ecosystem through small projects that benefit the community. RPC Client Libraries RPC is short for ‘remote procedure call’. In a nutshell, creating RPC client libraries for specific programming languages will make Nimiq compatible with that programming language. There are numerous different programming languages out there and developers might specialize in a single one or be competent in a few different languages. However, like languages around the world, the thing to understand is that just because someone is bilingual in French and English, it doesn’t mean they can speak Spanish. The same is true when it comes to different programming languages. Source: Medium For example, if an RPC library was built for the exceptionally popular programming language ‘Java’, it would enable Java developers to build on Nimiq while coding in their favorite programming language. A Java library would also enable Android coders to use Nimiq in native mobile app. In short, the completion of these RPC client libraries means that the Nimiq Ecosystem can draw from a greater pool of developer talent, opening up to a wide variety of programming languages and use cases. The Community RPC Client Libraries Bounty Competition The Community Funding Board explored different options to reward and incentivize Nimiq Community developers to create RPC client libraries for different programming languages. One case study that was discussed at length was the Binance API competition, where programmers were tasked with making the Binance API compatible with eight different languages. In the Binance developer competition, an equal BNB coin reward was granted for each programming language. However, the board decided to recognize the varying levels of difficulty in creating an RPC client library for different languages and decided that the reward should reflect the amount of work required. After debate, it was agreed awards would be assigned according to effort but also popularity and reach of the respective programming language resulting in a three levels: low, medium and high. Low = 200K NIM | Medium = 400K NIM | High = 600K NIM The consensus of the board was that rewards should be in NIM, rather than USD to align incentives. This means that the final decision was to assign the following RPC client library bounties: Python - low | 200K NIM PHP - high | 600K NIM Swift - high | 600K NIM  Java / Kotlin - high | 600K NIM Go - medium | 400K NIM Ruby - medium | 400K NIM  Python was assigned a low difficulty rating because the Python RPC library has already been started. Both Go and Ruby were deemed low priority for the Community Funding Board. However, it was acknowledged that quite a lot of people use Ruby for web apps and this made it a more interesting programming language than others in the ‘low’ category.  Bounty criteria  The Board agreed that bounties should be: Rewarded on a broad first-come, first-served basis. There will be a window of one month after the first submission for other submissions to be made. In the case of multiple submissions, Team Nimiq and the Community Funding Board would choose the best one to reward with the bounty. Based on how the Nimiq community acts to these new bounties, the Community Funding Board commits to monitoring, fine-tuning and refining bounty rewards. Shared Network Bounty Right now, when using the standard JavaScript library, a Nimiq node is created in each app. This task aims at re-using the same node and thus sharing the consensus over multiple Nimiq apps. This comes with two nice side-effects: new apps can access the consensus instantly, plus resources are being saved. More about the technical specs of this bounty can be found here. The Community Funding Board decided to assign this task a high rating to recognize the difficulty of executing it. This means that a 1 Million NIM reward is up for grabs here. Community Board Reactive Rewards The Board also felt it was important to devise a system to recognize past contributions to the Nimiq Ecosystem, new ideas, continuation of old ideas, and especially reward those who have just gone ahead and built cool stuff with Nimiq. For the board, it is important to ensure that there is a mechanism to show appreciation to those that contribute positively to the community.  In terms of assigning these awards, it will be up to the discretion of the Community Funding Board. However, this month the Board decided to recognize the following community members: Thomkha - for his documentation on how to run the Nimiq Rust node on Android.  Smittop - for his cool pixel auction solution powered by NIM. Mario - Nimiq widget. Sushi Pool - Sushi Pool is closing down and the Board wanted to grant a reward as a token of Nimiq’s appreciation for their past work. The Board also discussed an old proposal for a NIM/ETH cross-chain atomic swap tool and debated if this old project would be fitting for another community bounty. The outcome was that Nimiq Core should be consulted to see if OASIS would make the project obsolete. Finally… The Community Funding Board is still accepting proposals for funding and mentoring. If you have a great idea and need a little help to get it off the ground, please do follow our proposal submission guide and email your idea to proposals [at] nimiq [dot] com. With Nimiq OASIS and Albatross on the horizon, the question is: do you believe that Nimiq is the future of simple money? If so, it is time to get building and remember the Community Funding Board is here to support you for each and every step. To do is to dare. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Plastic waste is a major source of pollution. Can crypto become part of the solution to help clean our oceans?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[NIM is the cryptocurrency for humans created by Nimiq, a non-profit and open-source project founded in the beach town of Santa Teresa, Costa Rica. Santa Teresa is a remote place that has since started to grow and is currently the center of the Silicon Paradise initiative, you can learn more about that here. Nimiq is an Inuit word, it means “A force that binds things together”. Following this, we believe that communities are bound together by this force as they are all about helping one another and keeping alive the values that make them unique. As part of the local Santa Teresa community, Team Nimiq shares eco-friendly values and is especially akin to protecting the oceans, rivers, and beaches.  That's why Team Nimiq joined the #TeamSeas campaign by matching donations made through the Nimiq shop. You can read more about it here. However, collaborating with #TeamSeas through donations didn't seem enough, also from a personal level, as we love going for a swim on the weekend. You can occasionally find Nimiq Devs gazing at the sunset or going for a walk after a long day of coding Nimiq's new Proof-of-Stake Blockchain: Nimiq 2.0.  It is because of this personal connection with the ocean, water, and beautiful beach community here in Santa Teresa that we as a project want to support local efforts, even if our contributions are small. We hope that people are encouraged and motivated by this small but strong community. Here are their stories. L-ECO L-ECO is a local effort that focuses on collecting plastics and microplastics from the beach. Through eco-friendly processes, they transform these plastics (mostly bottle caps) into all sorts of daily use items such as building bricks, napkin holders, surfboard wax combs, and even artwork. They are supported by local shops, restaurants, and hotels that use their products in an effort to convey these eco-friendly values on which Santa Teresa is built. L-ECO was founded with the idea that “ethical compromise, the intellectual process, and survival instinct all intersect with the philosophy of sustainability.” The Face Behind The Story Alejandro or “El Che”, the creator of L-ECO block, has lived in Santa Teresa for over 20 years. He is a local bread salesman and a beloved member of the community. Originally from Argentina, every morning El Che takes his bicycle on his route to deliver delicious fresh baked bread around town. It was during his daily commute that he started seeing plastic all over the place until one day he had an idea and decided to take action.  With a piece of equipment that he built and attached to his bicycle, he collects plastics and microplastics, and ingeniously separates them from sand and other sediments through a manual filtering process. After gathering the plastic comes the task of classifying it. Not all plastics are the same and Alejandro is very mindful of this so that he does not create any additional pollution. Once the plastic has been classified, he heats up and compresses it into usable shapes. In his own words “These are not the prettiest of all items — we agree here — but they hold significant value. When you hold these pieces of craftsmanship you feel something different inside of you, that feeling is the power of change.”  Back in 2018, Team Nimiq met Alejandro. After listening to him and his enthusiasm for conservation, a furnace was donated so that he could process the plastics he was picking up from Santa Teresa beach. We are very excited to announce that, years later, the same furnace is still up and running. Alejandro’s gentle heart has also captivated ex-pats from all over town. This has allowed L-ECO to grow beyond what he conceived. His workshop is hosted by Thomas Richie, one of the first foreigners that — enticed by its natural beauty — moved to Santa Teresa. Thomas became his sponsor, but more importantly, his good friend and ally in this endeavor. Through donations and support, you can help Alejandro and Thomas continue this valuable effort. More details on that below. The power of volunteers  While Che started this effort alone, it’s not a one-man job. Through the years, many people have helped Che collect the plastic, each contributing with their part. One, in particular, decided to stay.  Juana came to Santa Teresa from Argentina three years ago. She is a craftswoman who had never taken part in ecological projects before, but much like the rest of the community, she was inspired by Che and Thomas’s actions. Originally, she joined the beach clean-up efforts, helping Che rally people and working with other local organizations to spread the message.  One day, while Che was building a napkin holder made out of bottle caps, she thought to herself “This could be much nicer” and started collaborating permanently especially on the aesthetic part of the products, imprinting herself and her personality in L-ECO. Juana didn't stop there, she then proceeded to create and manage L-ECO’s Instagram account and is currently working on their website, bringing color and youth to the company.  In her own words “Social media is the best way to show people what is happening. Most people have a phone and if you can reach them on Instagram or YouTube maybe they can start realizing the extent of the problem. There is a lot of plastic in the world and we can reuse it. If you want to help, visit our social media channels, or better yet, visit us in Santa Teresa and see what we do and how we use the plastic.'' L-ECO Project is offering their products and services for crypto! If you are visiting Playa Santa Teresa, in Costa Rica, make sure to check out Nimiq Silicon Paradise to find this and other merchants accepting crypto. At L-ECO you can get a beach clean-up tour and support them by buying products made of plastic recovered from the beach. Nicoya Peninsula Waterkeepers The Nicoya Peninsula Waterkeepers are members of the Waterkeeper Alliance, a worldwide effort made up of over 350 organizations. The purpose of the organization is to tackle the problems of pollution in coastlines, rivers, and lakes through grassroots actions. The guiding principle of Waterkeepers is that without water, there can be no life, and without clean water, there can be no healthy life.  The organization focuses on four main courses of action: waste management, water management, education & awareness, and Law enforcement.  To tackle solid waste management, the not-for-profit organization runs a recycling operation together with their partner Bionic, collecting over 200 tons of recyclable material a year. They also help local community groups like L-ECO organize beach clean-ups and to educate people about the issue.  The idea is not just to clean the beach, but instead, to help people understand the magnitude of the problem. Once you have seen so many discarded plastic items, you might wonder if you needed them in the first place. Some members of Team Nimiq also joined locals in a beach clean-up to see it for themselves and came to the same conclusion. Removing trash from the beach is only a temporary solution, an exercise in consciousness regarding the real source of the problem: overconsumption of plastic in everyday items, from a toothbrush to a toy. For water management and awareness, NP Waterkeepers focus on education. They reach out to people and talk to them. Problems like the consequences of flushing a toilet that is not connected to a septic tank or trash being thrown into rivers are emphasized. The idea is to rekindle the connection that humans have with water and its natural cycles. They have several community outreach programs and welcome everybody that wishes to be educated, including Nimiq. There you can learn about water pollution and bad practices that do not comply with the law. Law enforcement can be employed when private citizens or businesses are polluting. NP Waterkeepers work closely with authorities so that they can come and check what businesses are doing. The first approach is always friendly, they try to educate and give out the necessary information in order to solve the problem, but when there is negligence, they come with the full weight of the law. With their effort and kind heart, the NP Waterkeepers have become an integral part of the Santa Teresa community. Meeting the first NP Waterkeeper Carolina Chavarria is no stranger to humanitarian work. Born in Costa Rica, her willingness to help others took her abroad. Before being a Waterkeeper, Carolina used to work for an NGO. She has worked in Africa and war-torn countries, focusing on humanitarian help and establishing community development strategies. When she returned to Costa Rica, she was contacted by the Hecht family. As it turns out, the Hecht family is an active member of the global Waterkeepers organization and they decided to impact Santa Teresa and Cobano for the better. They armed Carolina with funding and a new mission, to build the team of now 15 members forming the Nicoya Peninsula Waterkeepers. As the years have gone by, NP Waterkeepers has become an important part of daily life for the community. Today, they are not funded by a single family, instead, they receive funding from various actors that wish for Santa Teresa to be clean instead of polluted. This additional funding has enabled NP Waterkeepers to run more educational projects and further impact people's lives. The Big Takeaway Having spoken to Carolina and Che it became increasingly obvious how it's all about connecting people. Connecting people who wish to help, like Thomas Richie and the Hecht family, with people who need help in order to continue their mission. We hope for the Silicon Paradise initiative to bring these people together and have an even bigger impact in Santa Teresa. Finally, our biggest takeaway from meeting with these local projects is that change can only occur through education and mindfulness. Picking up plastic from the beach is not a permanent solution. We decided to use our reach to help spread the message of our community here at Santa Teresa. However, local heroes exist in all communities and we encourage you to help them spread their message as well. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last December, we shared an update on the recent progress being made by Team Nimiq. Times fly by when there is so much going on — with Nimiq and the crypto space in general! Now we have more updates for you, so get comfy, grab your favorite beverage and let’s begin! Blockchain Team LibP2P Integration LibP2P is a network library created by Protocol Labs and coded in many languages including Rust, which is the one Nimiq is using. This modular network stack is designed to allow projects to mix and match building blocks of networking functionality. On top of that, the LibP2P implementation is built to also work in the browser’s network stack, thus a good step for Nimiq 2.0 to run in the browser while reusing the great work done by Protocol Labs already. Reusing this code has the big advantage of having an independent team working and improving the code instead of us recreating the code and maintaining it. In recent weeks, Nimiq Developers have been wrestling with some edge case bugs while integrating LibP2P into Nimiq 2.0, but it looks like we’re winning! Testnet Intensive work is going towards setting up more and more complex test environments and running the Testnet implementation in it to do more and more thorough testing and debugging to get the Testnet ready for the public release. As part of the process, a docker image has been created to set up a local Testnet on developers machines. As this will be useful for the Nimiq dev community, the image will be released publicly with the Testnet including documentation and instructions. Nano Consensus To have Nimiq 2.0 run on mobile devices and other low-specs devices, we need to find a smart way to establish consensus on devices without syncing the entire blockchain — similar to the nano clients using NiPoPoW in Nimiq 1.0. The solution is to share a ("zero-knowledge") proof — you can find all the details here — and that code was delivered in January and is now in a debugging and testing phase.  Staking With the Testnet getting closer to completion, the team is planning how to tackle some important details of how staking and unstaking will work optimally from a UI perspective. These topics are only on the drawing table at the moment, but we think they can be interesting for some community members. Nimiq 2.0 will need two transactions for unstaking, one to signal that you no longer want to stake and a second one to retrieve your funds once they are unstaked, which happens after the next macro block, maximum twelve hours later. Nimiq devs have been discussing how to keep the blockchain secure while ensuring a good user experience. The current solution we are working on is to sign both transactions at the same time and create some service that relays the second required transactions into the network after the next macro block — it’s an optional service that will make the system easier to use but does not compromise decentralization. Validators To improve the blockchain usability, Nimiq devs made it possible to switch validators instantly, with a single transaction. Also, validators can now be referred to by a unique identifier. Even when a validator gets updated, the ID stays the same. OASIS Infrastructure Deployment of the commercial grade infrastructure is in its final stages. This includes separating the three crucial components: public HTLC API, settlement (which knows secrets to be able to send out payments) and clearing (checking for incoming transactions) — which is an important security measure. Also metrics and monitoring are being added to check for errors and be ready to scale. These are the last steps to get the setup production ready. Implementation Simplifying fee structure, making the API easier to use. Improving status information about ingoing and outgoing transactions — which is much more complex for the traditional banking world than for crypto; detect and reimburse transactions that were mistakenly (or unknowingly) submitted as non-instant. Front-end Ledger The latest Nimiq Hub can now do crypto-crypto as well as fiat-crypto swaps with the Ledger! Behind the scenes, the Ledger API lib saw a major update. The original implementation was using workarounds for communicating with the Ledger device, but the web standards have dramatically improved and now it was time to replace the workaround with a proper implementation using all these new and beautiful web APIs. While doing that, multi-coin support has been added, allowing the lib to support Bitcoin now. On top of that, Bluetooth support has been added as well, so that work can begin in the Wallet to support the new Ledger Nano X via Bluetooth. The lib has been reworked from scratch with a new architecture, opening it up for reuse by other developers that want to integrate Ledgers into their web apps. The next step is to update the Nimiq Ledger app (the program running on your Ledger device) to the latest Ledger UI standards and adding more functionality. Wallet Update Front-end team has been working on a new version of the wallet which was released recently. It includes following important updates: New sign-up flow: Users are now required to download their Login File when creating an account. While this seems to put more effort on the user side, we had regular support requests from people asking to help them to restore their account after they lost access. But of course this is crypto, if you don’t have a back-up, we can’t help you. So now, the Login File will just automatically download when creating a new account — just takes a second and if you really need it, you’ll at least find it in your downloads folder. Improved password limits: New passwords are limited to 256 characters. Too much? We just put an upper bound to avoid users messing with the wallet by entering incredibly long passwords in an attempt to break things. iOS/Safari improvements: New accounts are no longer named "1" or "2" in the Wallet, but instead show their correct (initial background color based) name, translated to your language. Improved UX: The team and designers went through the entire UI — for mobile and desktop — and polished small visual bugs and issues. So the UIs are even more beautiful now. iOS/Safari: New accounts have BTC enabled automatically now, no more manual activation needed! Reduced size: A thorough clean-up led to removal of unnecessary code, resulting in a smaller bundle size when loading the wallet and components. As you might have noticed, the team is completely focused in Nimiq 2.0 and OASIS. While a lot of progress has been made we continue with full energy to tackle the challenges ahead. As always thank you for joining us on this journey. Pura Vida, Team Nimiq]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Powering up the Nimiq Community Funding Board]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nimiq Incubator is a new effort that aims to connect developers with community members that bring interesting skills to the table like providing ideas, managing projects, designing, marketing and more. The Community Funding Board was initiated as a way for community members to get the necessary resources to kickstart their project and encourage the creation of projects building on top of Nimiq Technology. Recently we have noticed a missing ingredient, given that the board itself is developer-oriented while projects in general rarely require only developers. The solution we found is to build a new middle layer between the community and the board: the Nimiq Incubator, or the Nimcubator as we like to call it. The recent board elections are the perfect moment to try out the new Nimcubator. One of the new community board representatives, Diese, has offered to help guide this effort. This will make sure that the Nimcubator is made by the community, for the community. How does it work? A new channel for brainstorming has been added to Nimiq Discord and Nimiq Telegram. In this channel, every Nimiq supporter can share ideas and discuss potential projects. Diese, Nimiqubator’s manager, will select users who are active and have a particular set of skills that will be valuable for future projects. Users will then be invited to the “ThinkTank” section of the Nimcubator to begin contributing and create proposals with the guidance of Diese and members of Team Nimiq. How can I participate? Join the Discord Channel or the Telegram Channel and start brainstorming with other Nimiq community members. You can also contact Diese over Telegram or Discord to share your ideas and/or skills. If you remain active and interested in contributing to the Nimiq Ecosystem, you might be accepted into the Nimcubator to make your project a reality. Adding for-profit efforts Even though the Community Funding Board will remain a non-for-profit effort, an Incubator like the one we are proposing has the potential of bringing to life projects which have some business component to them. We are open to hearing ideas and proposals that both strengthen the Nimiq Ecosystem and make some revenue for the founders. Those projects will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis and can be considered as potential projects for the Nimcubator. What are the benefits? What do you get by joining the Nimcubator?  You will learn about new projects before the rest of the community. You will be able to test the projects and give ideas to the founders. You can receive guidance and support from other Nimcubator members and Team Nimiq. You help strengthen the Nimiq Ecosystem. We want to take this opportunity to thank Diese for stepping up to guide this effort and continue building and expanding the most easy-to-use ecosystem for blockchain-powered apps. Go Nimiq!]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Nimiq Shop Directory Backend and Community Awards ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to another report of the Community Funding Board. The Nimcubator has been increasing its activity and that certainly is notable in the increasing proposals coming from this source. Without further ado, let’s get right to it. Nimiq Shop Directory Map This idea has been around for quite a while since it has a lot of potential. A website that displays shops that accept Nimiq as a payment. The discussion in this meeting was mainly technical since there has been a lot of more general talk around it in the Nimcubator already. There are already proponents willing to start working on this, and it became clear that there is a lot to discuss about this project. The result was to create a bounty for the backend of the Shop Directory and start from there. Here are the details of the project: The project scope: This project is specifically about the backend, the database that holds records of the shops and provides an open API for developers who want to use such data. This is what is considered for the bounty now. Frontend: The web app that users interact with. It would retrieve data from the database and display it for the users. The hosting: Makes sense to search technology that is not platform-specific which would force hosting to be in such a platform. The one example we discussed is to avoid using Microsoft and preferring open source. The bounty: We discussed to provide 3000 USD payable in NIM to whoever successfully completes this milestone of the Shop Directory. The details can be found here Nimiq Community Awards This week the Awards go to Nimiq_Maniaq, Cappex666 and Taiko28 for their amazing work at getting the word out and educating new users about Nimiq. As a token of our appreciation we want to reward them with 2000 NIM We also want to reward Mario Fritz for his recent contributions to the Nimiq project with 4000 NIM. It is great to have Coders like Mario in our community, who are always coming up with new projects and are testing the Nimiq apps. Thanks for joining us in this edition of the Community Funding Board. Remember to check the community funding section of the website for more details on the recent bounty and other details of the Community Funding Board. Until the next one. Pura Vida Community Funding Board]]></content:encoded>
