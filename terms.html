      <p>
        Your Ether (the token of the Ethereum blockchain or “ETH”) contribution to the Nimiq Crowdsale Smart Contract to
        create and receive Nimiq Exchange Tokens (“NET”) during the NET creation period (“Creation Period”) from Nimiq
        Network Ltd is subject to these Terms. Nimiq Network Ltd, the sponsor, is called “Company”, “we,” or “us”
        herein. Each of you (“Contributor” or “you") and Company is a “Party,” and together the “Parties.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nimiq Crowdsale Smart Contract (“Smart Contract System”) code is adapted by the Company and deployed on the
        Ethereum protocol with the address provided at nimiq.com and is incorporated by reference herein (<a
          href="https://github.com/nimiq-network/nimiq-exchange-token/tree/master/contracts"

      </p>
      <p>
        By contributing ETH to create NET during the Creation Period and/or using NET exchanged to Tokens of the Nimiq
        Mainnet (“NIM”) for interaction on the Nimiq Mainnet (as defined below), you agree to be bound to these Terms
        and all terms incorporated by reference. NIM tokens enable the usage of and interaction with the decentralized
        Nimiq Mainnet and Ecosystem (“Nimiq Network”) that the Company and its affiliates are developing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information contained on the website, in press releases, interviews, blogs, vlogs or social media is of a
        descriptive nature only, is not binding and does not form part of the Terms, unless expressly repeated herein.
        <span class="bold"
          >If you are in any doubt about the content or meaning of these Terms or the action, consult with your
          solicitor, accountant or other professional adviser before contribution or any other action.</span

      </p>
      <p class="italic">You and Company further agree as follows:</p>
      <p class="bold">
        You understand that NET confer only the right to receive NIM for usage and interaction on the Nimiq Network. You
        are not contributing ETH to create and receive NET for any other purposes, including, but not limited to, any
        investment, speculative or other financial purposes.

      <p>
        Contributing ETH to the Smart Contract System and receiving ownership or control of NET carries no rights,
        express or implied, including, but not limited to, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation,
        proprietary, IP, financial or legal rights. NET is only the means to obtain NIM that allow usage and interaction
        with the Nimiq Network, if the network is successfully completed and deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You understand that no market liquidity is guaranteed and that the value of NET and/or NIM over time may

      <p class="chapter-title">
        <span class="chapter-number">III.</span>
        Acknowledgment and Assumption of Risks
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that there are risks associated with transferring ETH to the Smart Contract System to
        create NET, receiving and holding NET, and exchanging NET to NIM and using and transacting with NIM on the Nimiq
        Network as described herein.
        <span class="important"
          >If you have any questions regarding these risks, please contact us at
          <span class="underline">info at nimiq dot com</span>.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        BY CONTRIBUTING ETH TO THE Smart Contract System, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME THESE PARTICULAR BUT NOT
        EXHAUSTIVE RISKS:
      </p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risk of software weaknesses</span>: The User understands and accepts that the Smart
          Contract System, the underlying software application, and software platform (i.e. the blockchain) is still in
          development, that there will be no warranty that the process for creating NET or NIM will be uninterrupted or
          error- free and that there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or
          bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH, NET and/or NIM. The technology is still experimental which
          carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks. Accordingly,
          there is no warranty, including direct or indirect warranties that the Smart Contract System and NET and NIM
          are fit for its purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold"
            >Risk of Losing Access to NET Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Password(s), Custodial Error or Contributor
            Error</span
          >: Following the creation of NET by the Smart Contract System, the NET will be transferred to your own account
          (address) on the Ethereum network by the Smart Contract System. A private key, or a combination of private
          keys and password(s), is necessary to control and manage NET stored in your digital wallet or vault.
          Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) and/or password(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault
          storing NET will result in loss of such NET. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private
          key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a digital wallet or vault service you use, may be
          able to misappropriate your NET. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital
          wallet or vault you choose to receive and store NET, including your own failure to properly maintain or use
          such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your NET. Additionally, your failure to follow
          precisely the procedures for buying and receiving NET, including, for instance, if you provide the wrong
          address for receiving NET, may result in the loss of your NET. You understand that you must keep your password
          and private key safe and that you must not share them with anyone. You further understand that if your private
          key and/or password is lost or stolen, you will not be able to generate a new password or recover your private
          key, and you also lose your private keys and password, the NET associated with your account (address) will be
          unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. Furthermore, you understand that there is no recovery mechanism
          for lost keys and passwords, so no one will be able to help you retrieve or reconstruct a lost password and
          private keys and provide you with access to any lost NET.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol</span>: Because NET are based on the Ethereum
          protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse
          effect on NET. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum
          computing, could present risks to NET by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that
          underpins the Ethereum protocol.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risks Associated with the Nimiq Protocol</span>: Advances in cryptography or technical
          advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to NIM and the Mainnet, including
          the utility of NIM for transacting, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that
          underpins the Nimiq protocol.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risk of Mining Attacks</span>: As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on
          the Ethereum protocol, NET are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating NET transactions
          on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power
          attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to NET, including, but not limited
          to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving NET. Similarly the Nimiq protocol will be
          susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating NIM transactions on the Nimiq blockchain,
          including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining
          attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to NIM, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and
          recording of transactions involving NIM.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risk of Hacking, Theft and Security Weaknesses</span>: Hackers or other malicious groups or
          organizations may attempt to interfere with the Nimiq Mainnet in a variety of ways, including, but not limited
          to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.
          Furthermore, because the Mainnet is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a
          member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core
          infrastructure of the Mainnet, which could negatively affect the Mainnet and NIM, including NIM utility for
          transacting on the Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risks Associated with Markets for NET</span>: NIM are intended to be used solely on the
          Nimiq Mainnet, and Company will not promote any secondary trading or external valuation of NET and NIM. This
          restricts the contemplated avenues for using NET to obtain Services or access the Mainnet, and could therefore
          create illiquidity risk with respect to NET you hold. Even if secondary trading of NET is facilitated by third
          party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making
          them more susceptible to market-related risks. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an
          external exchange value to NET (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be
          extremely volatile and diminish to zero.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold"
            >Risk of abandonment, failure, or lack of success of the Nimiq Network or its components</span
          >: You understand and accepts that the creation of NET and the development of Nimiq Network may be fully or
          partially abandoned for several reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of
          commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). You therefore understand that there is no
          assurance that, even if Nimiq Network is partially or fully developed and launched, you will receive any
          benefits through the NET and/or NIM held by you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risk of Uninsured Losses</span>: Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial
          institutions, NET and NIM are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus,
          in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit
          Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risks Associated with Uncertain Tax, Regulations and Enforcement Actions</span>: The legal,
          regulatory and tax status of NET and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many
          jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation
          with respect to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether
          legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger
          technology and its applications, including the Mainnet, NET and NIM. Regulatory actions could negatively
          impact the Mainnet, NET and NIM in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a
          determination that NET and NIM are a regulated financial instrument that require registration or licensing.
          Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or
          regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the
          necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risk of Alternative Mainnets</span>: It is likely that alternative versions of the Nimiq
          Mainnet (“alt-nimiq” or “forks”) will be released as separate blockchains, and these chains will compete
          against the official Nimiq for value. Successfully acquiring NIM through the exchange from NET only guarantees
          that you will receive NIM on the official network, not any forks. The Mainnet may compete with these forks,
          which would negatively impact the Mainnet and NIM, including NIM utility for transacting on the Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Mainnet or Distributed Applications</span>: It is
          possible that the Nimiq Mainnet will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other
          entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed Mainnets
          (such as the Nimiq Mainnet) more generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the
          development of the Nimiq Mainnet and the potential utility of NIM, including its utility for transacting on
          the Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Mainnet</span>: The Mainnet is
          still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for NIM and the
          Nimiq Mainnet to follow the specifications and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we
          may have to make changes to the specifications, including but not limited to the development plan, naming,
          branding and design, of NIM or the Nimiq Mainnet for any number of legitimate reasons. This could create the
          risk that NIM or the Nimiq Mainnet, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the
          time of contributing to create NET. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the
          Nimiq Mainnet, it is still possible that the Mainnet will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be
          adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Mainnet and the potential utility of NIM,
          including its utility for transacting on the Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether and Diversification</span>: The Company team
          intends to use the ETH contributions from the Crowdsale to fund the maintenance and development of the Nimiq
          Mainnet, as described further in the Terms and Exhibit B. The ETH contributions may, at our discretion, be
          converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of ETH or other currencies fluctuates
          unfavorably during or after the Creation Period, the Company team may not be able to fund development, or may
          not be able to develop or maintain the Nimiq Mainnet in the manner that it intended.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risk of Dissolution of the Company</span>: It is possible that, due to any number of
          reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of ETH (or other cryptographic
          and fiat currencies), decrease in NIM utility (including its utility for transacting on the Nimiq Mainnet),
          the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Nimiq Mainnet may
          no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</span>: Because NET and NIM confer no
          governance rights of any kind with respect to the Nimiq Network or Company, all decisions involving the Nimiq
          Network or Company will be made by Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to
          discontinue the Mainnet, to sell more NET or NIM for use in the Mainnet, or to sell or liquidate the Company.
          These decisions could adversely affect the Nimiq Network and the utility of NET or NIM that you hold and
          including NIM utility for transacting on the Nimiq Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Unanticipated Risks</span>: Cryptographic tokens such as NET and NIM are a new and untested
          technology. In addition to the risks included herein, there are other risks associated with your contribution,
          holding and use of NET or NIM, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further
          materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed above.
        </li>

        Description of Company<br />
        Nimiq Network Ltd and the Nimiq Network
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Company is incorporated in Tortola, BVI. Company has the primary objective to administer the development of
        Nimiq Network.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-title">NET and NIM</p>
      <p>
        NET are interim token representing the right to exchange for NIM, the token of the Nimiq Mainnet, prior to the
        launch of the Nimiq Mainnet. NET are created by transferring ETH to the Smart Contract address made available at
        nimiq.com during the Creation Period and at the Creation Rate as described in Exhibit B. NET are based on the
        Ethereum protocol and conform to the ERC20 standard. NIM are the Tokens of the Nimiq Mainnet and protocol and
        allow usage and interaction with the Nimiq Network and its Ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-title">Nimiq Mainet</p>
      <p>
        Nimiq Network is a decentralized, open source, browser based, blockchain protocol. On June 6, 2017 we released
        the BetaNet, a first stable version of the Nimiq blockchain to showcase the world’s first “Blockchain in a
        Browser” for testing and development purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our intention is to launch the Nimiq Mainnet by the end of this or early next year. An expected condition to
        launching the Mainnet is completing all of the advanced features of the protocol. Advanced Features are expected
        to include: sophisticated light-clients, memory-hard proof-of-work, lightning network primitives and primitives
        for a P2P-Exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        The parameters determining the Nimiq Mainnet Tokens amount and creation will be designed for a total final
        supply of 21 Million NIM with the following distribution:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          up to 1’050’000 NIM from exchange of NET from Token Sale Contributors with immediate vesting after the launch
          of Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          525’000 NIM for a Nimiq long-term endowment foundation vesting ratably over 10 years in 6 month increments at
          the end of each increment after the launch of Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          420’000 NIM for a Nimiq non-profit organization funding good cause partnerships and sponsorships vesting
          ratably over 10 years in 6 month increments at the end of each increment after the launch of Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          315’000 NIM for early contributors vested 50% in 3 months and the remainder in 6 month after the launch of
          Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          210’000 NIM for the Nimiq founders with ratable vesting over 3 years in 6 month increments after the launch of
          Mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>
          All remaining NIM would be created through mining over a period of up to 100 years. We might switch from
          Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. In such case the total supply cap of 21 Million NIM could be reduced. This
          would not reduce the amount of NIM held by Token Sale Contributors, so that it would be beneficial to Token
          Sale Contributors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although Company intends to develop the Mainnet in the manner generally described above, it reserves the right
        to modify features, functionalities, branding or development plans in its sole and absolute discretion.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
        Further details regarding the Nimiq Mainnet are described in a whitepaper, available at:
        <a href="https://medium.com/nimiq-network/nimiq-a-peer-to-peer-payment-protocol-native-to-the-web-ffd324bb084"

      </p>

      <p class="chapter-title">Ecosystem</p>
      <p>
        We plan on following the encompassing approach of building both a protocol and an app ecosystem to streamline
        them into one frictionless and consistent experience. The user-facing apps of our ecosystem are the heart of a
        frictionless payment experience, because they accompany customers, merchants and developers through the full
        process. Development of the ecosystem of applications is independent of the Mainnet and the Mainnet launch does
        not depend on it.

            received into the Smart Contract System or (ii) the maximum of 10’500’000 NET have been created (“Creation
            Cap”) or (iii) mining commences on Ethereum block 4081130, whichever is earlier (the “Creation Period”).
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on current Ethereum block mining times, the Company estimates that Ethereum block 3942670 will be
            mined on or about 1:00 PM UTC on June 28, 2017, and that Ethereum block 4081130 will be mined on or about 28
            days thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, these estimates are provided for informational purposes only,
            and the Sale Period will commence and conclude according to its definition above.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="bold">Activation Threshold</p>
          <p>
            If less than 5’000 ETH have been received by the Smart Contract System during the Creation Period (the
            “Activation Threshold”), each Contributor will have the possibility to initiate the transfer of the
            respective amount of Ether submitted to the Smart Contract System from the Smart Contract System’s address
            back to the address used by that Contributor to transfer Ether to the Smart Contract System.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="bold">Creation Rate</p>
          <p>
            In the first two weeks from start of the Creation Period, 1 ETH transferred to the Smart Contract will
            create 175 NET. In the second two weeks from start of the Creation Period 1 ETH transferred to the Smart
            Contract will create 125 NET. The switch to the second Creation Rate happens with mining on Ethereum block
            4011900.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="bold">Minimum Contribution and Gas Limit</p>
          <p>
            The minimum contribution required for the Smart Contract System to accept the transaction is the equivalent
            of ETH to create 1 NET. For the Smart Contract System to process the transaction you have to add a
            sufficient Gas Limit to each transaction as specified by the Ethereum Network.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="bold">Procedures for Creating and Receiving NET (Smart Contract System)</p>
          <p>
            In order to contribute ETH to the Smart Contract System and to receive the created NET, you must have an
            Ethereum wallet that supports the ERC20 token standard. Company reserves the right to prescribe additional
            wallet requirements. Approximately forty-eight (36) hours prior to the commencement of the Creation Period,
            the Smart Contract System code should be deployed and the Ethereum address for the Crowdsale published via
            https:// nimiq.com (follow “Token Sale” and “Contribute” buttons). To initiate the creation and allocation
            to you of NET during the Sale Period, you must send an amount of ETH to the Ethereum address (the “NET
            Address”) that will be provided to you after you agree to these Terms by clicking the “I Agree with the
            Terms” button at the bottom of these Terms. Along with the NET Address and the amount of ETH you are
            transferring, you also need to enter a sufficient Gas Limit and the “Data Value” that is provided on the
            same page as the NET Address, in the respective Data Field of your compatible wallet. Sending Ether to the
            NET token Address during the Creation Period triggers a smart contract operation, pursuant to which the
            Smart Contract System will automatically create and deliver the corresponding NET to the ERC20 wallet
            address from which the ETH were sent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ether must be sent to the NET Address during the Creation Period in order to create and receive NET. Sending
            Ether to any other address may result in loss of your ETH. Attempted transactions to purchase NET will be
            rejected if Ether is sent to the NET Address at any time before or after the Sale Period, or if the “Data
            Value” Field is left empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Etherium, their Smart Contract System platform has been audited, programmed according to the
            current state of the art, and approved by its technical experts with respect to security and accuracy.

        <li>
          <p class="bold">Procedures for Creating and Receiving NIM</p>
          <p>
            Approximately two months before the Nimiq Mainnet launch we initiate and will announce via nimiq.com, press
            and social media channels the opening of the redeeming period. We will provide a tool for you to create the
            Nimiq account and address to which the NET equivalent NIM are going to be deposited. This is concluded by
            crediting the account with the corresponding NIM in the Genesis Block of the Nimiq Mainnet Blockchain. The
            exchange rate is fixed at 1 NIM = 10 NET and the tool will lead contributors through the simple process.
            Company reserves the right to adjust the procedure as it sees fit for the purpose of exchanging NET for NIM.
